The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain  non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common  in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or  beneficial (such as antioxidants).  4  |  Introduction'},\n",

There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.  Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can  be unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks  Introduction  |  5'},\n",

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is  stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber  is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by  digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes  through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that  inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.  One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of  energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to  providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger  macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning  of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose  can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage  molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is  known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.  Lipids  Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,  and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.  Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy  products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three  main  types  of  lipids  are  triglycerides  (triacylglycerols),  phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or  store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than  carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four  kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy  storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,  surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide  insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other  functions in the body.  6  |  Introduction'},\n",

Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon,  oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include  meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy.

Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two  hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60  percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could  be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not  occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would  fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters  of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so  critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and  output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in  Chapter 4.  Micronutrients  Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser  amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions.  Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins.  There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See  Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2  “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their  major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins,  micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist  in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e.,  coenzymes). Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions  in the body and are involved in all aspects of body functions from  producing  energy,  to  digesting  nutrients,  to  building  macromolecules.

To date, science has not been able to track the  exact path in the brain that occurs in response to eating a particular  food, but it is quite clear that foods, in general, stimulate emotional  responses in people. Food also has psychological, cultural, and  religious significance, so your personal choices of food affect your  mind, as well as your body. The social implications of food have a  great deal to do with what people eat, as well as how and when.  Special events in individual lives—from birthdays to funerals—are  commemorated with equally special foods. Being aware of these  forces can help people make healthier food choices—and still honor  the traditions and ties they hold dear.

Some foods that  are very healthy, such as tofu, may be unappealing at first to  many people. However, creative cooks can adapt healthy foods  to meet most people’s taste.  • Economics. Access to fresh fruits and vegetables may be scant,  particularly for those who live in economically disadvantaged  or remote areas, where cheaper food options are limited to  convenience stores and fast food.  • Early food experiences. People who were not exposed to  different foods as children, or who were forced to swallow  every last bite of overcooked vegetables, may make limited  food choices as adults.  • Habits. It’s common to establish eating routines, which can  work both for and against optimal health. Habitually grabbing a  fast food sandwich for breakfast can seem convenient, but  might not offer substantial nutrition. Yet getting in the habit of  drinking an ample amount of water each day can yield multiple  benefits.  • Culture. The culture in which one grows up affects how one  sees food in daily life and on special occasions.  • Geography. Where a person lives influences food choices. For  instance, people who live in Midwestern US states have less  access to seafood than those living along the coasts.  • Advertising. The media greatly influences food choice by  persuading consumers to eat certain foods.  • Social factors.

In addition, people who have never worried  about their weight have a very different approach to eating  than those who have long struggled with excess weight.  • Emotions. There is a wide range in how emotional issues affect  eating habits. When faced with a great deal of stress, some  people tend to overeat, while others find it hard to eat at all.  • Green food/Sustainability choices. Based on a growing  understanding of diet as a public and personal issue, more and  more people are starting to make food choices based on their  environmental impact. Realizing that their food choices help  shape the world, many individuals are opting for a vegetarian  diet, or, if they do eat animal products, striving to find the  most “cruelty-free” options possible. Purchasing local and  organic food products and items grown through sustainable  processes also helps shrink the size of one’s dietary footprint.

There are five key factors that make  up a healthful diet:  1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of  each essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories.  2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient  at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts  of all nutrients.  3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you  get from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of  energy you expend during your day’s activities.  4. Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too  much nor too little.  5. Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each  of the food groups on a regular basis.  A healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative  to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh  whole foods that have been sustaining people for generations.  Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein,  carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health.  Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients  and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and  trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of  diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer,  obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses. A balanced diet is a mix of food  from the different food groups (vegetables, legumes, fruits, grains,  protein foods, and dairy).  30  |  Achieving a Healthy Diet'},\n",

Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of  “empty-calorie” foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which  are also called “nutrient-poor.” Nutrient-dense foods include fruits  and vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and  whole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate  weight loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients.  Balance  Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails  not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example,  calcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much  calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are  good sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to  get the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a  proper balance between food choices is critical. Another example  is that while sodium is an essential nutrient, excessive intake may  contribute to congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease  in some people. Remember, everything must be consumed in the  proper amounts.  Moderation  Eat in moderation. Moderation is crucial for optimal health and  survival.

Monitor food portions. For optimum weight maintenance, it is  important to ensure that energy consumed from foods meets the  energy expenditures required for body functions and activity. If not,  the excess energy contributes to gradual, steady accumulation of  stored body fat and weight gain. In order to lose body fat, you need  to ensure that more calories are burned than consumed. Likewise,  in order to gain weight, calories must be eaten in excess of what is  expended daily.  Variety  Variety involves eating different foods from all the food groups.  Eating a varied diet helps to ensure that you consume and absorb  adequate amounts of all essential nutrients required for health. One  of the major drawbacks of a monotonous diet is the risk of  consuming too much of some nutrients and not enough of others.  Trying new foods can also be a source of pleasure—you never know  what foods you might like until you try them.  Developing a healthful diet can be rewarding, but be mindful that  all of the principles presented must be followed to derive maximal  health benefits. For instance, introducing variety in your diet can  still result in the consumption of too many high-calorie, nutrient  poor foods and inadequate nutrient intake if you do not also employ  moderation and calorie control.

To carry out  this isolation, he burned some seaweed and in the process, observed  an intense violet vapor that crystallized when he exposed it to a cold  surface. He sent the violet crystals to an expert on gases, Joseph  Gay-Lussac, who identified the crystal as a new element. It was  named iodine, the Greek word for violet. The following scientific  record is some of what took place in order to conclude that iodine  is a nutrient.  Observation.

Career Connection  What are some of the ways in which you think like a  scientist, and use the scientific method in your everyday  life? Any decision-making process uses some aspect of the  scientific method. Think about some of the major decisions  you have made in your life and the research you conducted  that supported your decision. For example, what brand of  computer do you own? Where is your money invested?  What college do you attend?  Evidence-Based Approach to Nutrition  It took more than one hundred years from iodine’s discovery as  an effective treatment for goiter until public health programs  recognized it as such. Although a lengthy process, the scientific  method is a productive way to define essential nutrients and  determine their ability to promote health and prevent disease.

Genes are part of DNA and contain the genetic  information that make up all of our traits. Genes are codes for  proteins and when they are turned “on” or “off,” they change how  the body works. While we know that health is defined as more than  just the absence of disease, there are currently very few accurate  genetic markers of good health. Rather, there are many more  genetic markers for disease. However, science is evolving, and  nutritional genetics aims to identify what nutrients to eat to “turn  on” healthy genes and “turn off” genes that cause disease.

Did the researcher(s) observe the  results themselves or did they rely on self reports from  program participants?  3. Who were the subjects of this study? Humans or animals?

Around the world, other cultures had  similar views of food and its relationship with health. A famous  quote by the Greek physician Hippocrates over two thousand years  ago, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” bear much  relevance on our food choices and their connection to our health.  Today, the scientific community echoes Hippocrates’ statement as  it recognizes some foods as functional foods. The Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics defines functional foods as “whole foods  and fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods that have a potentially  beneficial effect on health when consumed as part of a varied diet  on a regular basis, at effective levels.”  In the latter nineteenth century, a Russian doctor of immunology,  Elie Metchnikoff, was intrigued by the healthy life spans of people  who lived in the tribes of the northern Caucasus Mountains. What  contributed to their long lifespan and their resistance to life- threatening diseases? A possible factor lay wrapped up in a leather  satchel used to hold fermented milk. Observing the connection  between the beverage and longevity, Dr. Elie Metchnikoff began his  research on beneficial bacteria and the longevity of life that led to  his book, The Prolongation of Life. He studied the biological effects  and chemical properties of the kefir elixir whose name came from  the Turkish word “kef” or “pleasure.” To this day, kefir is one of the  most widely enjoyed beverages in Russia.

Expert nutritionists agree that probiotics, such as kefir,  reduce the symptoms of lactose intolerance and can ward off virally  caused diarrhea. While some health claims remain unsubstantiated,  scientific studies are ongoing to determine the validity of other  health benefits of probiotics.  The Native Hawaiians also consumed a daily probiotic in their  diet commonly known as poi (pounded taro). In precolonial Hawai‘i,  poi was used for a wide variety of dietary and medicinal purposes.  Aside from poi’s nutrient dense composition, fermented poi has  numerous compounds created in the fermentation process that are  very beneficial to the health of the human body. As a probiotic,  evidence suggests that poi can be useful in helping diseases such  as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory  bowel disease, and cancer.1  Another well-known probiotic to the local people of Hawai‘i is  Kimchi. Kimchi is a traditional Korean food that is manufactured by  fermenting vegetables (usually cabbage).

When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your  brain that it is time to eat. Sights and smells influence your body’s  preparedness for food. Smelling food sends a message to your brain.  Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to  salivate in preparation for a meal.  Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The  Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the  components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed  and taken into the body. To do this, the digestive system functions  on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and  chemically to break down large molecules. The smaller nutrient  molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout  the body for energy\\xa0 or used as building blocks for new cells. The  digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human  body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs  including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,  large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus. It is lined with mucosal  tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of  food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through  the tract). Smooth muscle tissue surrounds the digestive tract and  its contraction produces waves, known as peristalsis, that propel  food down the tract. Nutrients, as well as some non-nutrients, are  absorbed. Substances such as fiber get left behind and are  appropriately excreted.

The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract. It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry.  In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components.  Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth. Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward. The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow. Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System'},\n",

As you swallow, the bolus is pushed from the mouth  through the pharynx and into a muscular tube called the esophagus.  As the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the  epiglottis closes to prevent choking by keeping food from going  into the trachea. Peristaltic contractions also known as peristalsis in  the esophagus propel the food bolus down to the stomach (Figure  3.6 “Peristalsis in the Esophagus”). At the junction between the  esophagus and stomach there is a sphincter muscle that remains  closed until the food bolus approaches. The pressure of the food  bolus stimulates the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and open  and food then moves from the esophagus into the stomach. The  mechanical breakdown of food is accentuated by the muscular  contractions of the stomach and small intestine that mash, mix,  slosh, and propel food down the alimentary canal. Solid food takes  between four and eight seconds to travel down the esophagus, and  liquids take about one second.  Figure 2.6 Peristalsis in the Esophagus  The Digestive System  |  73'},\n",

Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that  also contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach. These  gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that  chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food.  The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the  macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein  meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates.  It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach  contents completely into the small intestine.  The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the  duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the  duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas  and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in  digestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of  pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day. This  fluid consists mostly of water, but it also contains bicarbonate ions  that neutralize the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and  enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and  lipids. The gallbladder secretes a much smaller amount of a fluid  called bile that helps to digest fats. Bile passes through a duct that  joins the pancreatic ducts and is released into the duodenum. Bile  is made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bile’s components  act like detergents by surrounding fats similar to the way dish soap  removes grease from a frying pan. This allows for the movement of  fats in the watery environment of the small intestine. Two different  types of muscular contractions, called peristalsis and segmentation,  control the movement and mixing of the food in various stages of  digestion through the small intestine.  Similar to what occurs in the esophagus and stomach, peristalsis  is circular waves of smooth muscle contraction that propel food  74  |  The Digestive System'},\n",

Neurons form the core of the central nervous system, which  consists of the brain, spinal cord, and other nerve bundles in the  body. The main function of the central nervous system is to sense  changes in the external environment and create a reaction to them.  For instance, if your finger comes into contact with a thorn on a  rose bush, a sensory neuron transmits a signal from your finger up  through the spinal cord and into the brain. Another neuron in the  brain sends a signal that travels back to the muscles in your hand  and stimulates muscles to contract and you jerk your finger away.  All of this happens within a tenth of a second. All nerve impulses  travel by the movement of charged sodium, potassium, calcium, and  chloride atoms. Nerves communicate with each other via chemicals  built from amino acids called neurotransmitters. Eating adequate  protein from a variety of sources will ensure the body gets all of the  different amino acids that are important for central nervous system  function.

Just as too much glucose is bad for other organs,  such as the kidneys and pancreas, it also produces negative effects  upon the brain. Excessive glucose levels in the blood can cause a  loss of cognitive function, and chronically high blood-glucose levels  can damage brain cells. The brain’s cognitive functions include  language processing, learning, perceiving, and thinking. Recent  scientific studies demonstrate that having continuously high blood- glucose levels substantially elevates the risk for developing  Alzheimer’s disease, which is the greatest cause of age-related  cognitive decline.  The good news is that much research is directed toward  determining the best diets and foods that slow cognitive decline and  maximize brain health. A study in the June 2010 issue of the Archives  of Neurology reports that people over age 65 who adhered to diets  that consisted of higher intakes of nuts, fish, poultry, tomatoes,  cruciferous vegetables, fruits, salad dressing, and dark green, and  leafy vegetables, as well as a lower intake of high-fat dairy products,  red meat, organ meat, and butter, had a much reduced risk for  Alzheimer’s disease.1  Other scientific studies provide supporting evidence that foods  rich in omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants provide the brain  with protection against Alzheimer’s disease.

This is because  cells need to maintain oxidative metabolism for energy production  that continuously regenerates adenosine triphosphate (ATP). For  oxidative phosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and  carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may be surprised  to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually  the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need  to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through  the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into  and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and  microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The  cardiovascular system transports gases from the lungs to tissues  throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect  the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic  obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of  these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in  labored breathing and other difficulties.  The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily  to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration, remove  the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base  balance. Portions of the respiratory system are also used for non- vital functions, such as sensing odors, producing speech, and for  straining, such as during childbirth or coughing.

The glands  secrete hormones, which are biological molecules that regulate  cellular processes in other target tissues, so they require  transportation by the circulatory system. Adequate nutrition is  critical for the functioning of all the glands in the endocrine system.  A protein deficiency impairs gonadal-hormone release, preventing  reproduction. Athletic teenage girls with very little body fat often  do not menstruate. Children who are malnourished usually do not  produce enough growth hormone and fail to reach normal height  for their age group. Probably the most popularized connection  between nutrition and the functions of the endocrine system is  that unhealthy dietary patterns are linked to obesity and the  development of Type 2 diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) estimates that twenty-six million Americans  have Type 2 diabetes as of 2011. This is 8.3 percent of the US  population. Counties with the highest incidence of obesity also have  the highest incidence of Type 2 diabetes.

The prevailing theory is that the overconsumption of  high-fat and high-sugar foods causes changes in muscle, fat, and  liver cells that leads to a diminished response from the pancreatic  hormone insulin. These cells are called “insulin-resistant.” Insulin is  released after a meal and instructs the liver and other tissues to take  up glucose and fatty acids that are circulating in the blood. When  cells are resistant to insulin they do not take up enough glucose and  fatty acids, so glucose and fatty acids remain at high concentrations  in the blood. The chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids in the  blood also causes damage to other tissues over time, so that people  who have Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular  disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye disease.

If the kidneys fail, these functions are compromised or lost  altogether, with devastating effects on homeostasis. The affected  individual might experience weakness, lethargy, shortness of  breath, anemia, widespread edema (swelling), metabolic acidosis,  rising potassium levels, heart arrhythmias, and more. Each of these  functions is vital to your well-being and survival. The urinary  system, controlled by the nervous system, also stores urine until  a convenient time for disposal and then provides the anatomical  structures to transport this waste liquid to the outside of the body.  Failure of nervous control or the anatomical structures leading to  a loss of control of urination results in a condition called  incontinence.  Characteristics of the urine change, depending on influences  such as water intake, exercise, environmental temperature, nutrient  intake, and other factors .

The skeleton is composed of two main  parts, the axial and the appendicular parts. The axial skeleton  consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, and is  composed of eighty bones. The appendicular skeleton consists of  the shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, and upper and lower extremities,  and is composed of 126 bones. Bones are also categorized by size  and shape. There are four types of bone: long bones, short bones,  flat bones, and irregular bones. The longest bone in your body is the  femur (thigh bone), which extends from your hip to your knee. It is a  long bone and functions to support your weight as you stand, walk,  or run. Your wrist is composed of eight irregular-shaped bones,  which allow for the intricate movements of your hands. Your twelve  ribs on each side of your body are curved flat bones that protect  your heart and lungs. Thus, the bones’ different sizes and shapes  allow for their different functions.  Bones are composed of approximately 65 percent inorganic  material known as mineralized matrix. This mineralized matrix  consists of mostly crystallized hydroxyapatite. The bone’s hard  crystal matrix of bone tissue gives it its rigid structure. The other  35 percent of bone is organic material, most of which is the fibrous  protein collagen. The collagen fibers are networked throughout  bone tissue and provide it with flexibility and strength. The bones’  inorganic and organic materials are structured into two different  tissue types. There is spongy bone, also called trabecular or  cancellous bone, and compact bone, also called cortical bone  (Figure 2.26 “The Arrangement of Bone Tissues”). The two tissue  types differ in their microarchitecture and porosity. Trabecular  bone is 50 to 90 percent porous and appears as a lattice-like  structure under the microscope.

Bone Modeling and Remodeling  During infancy, childhood, and adolescence, bones are continuously  growing and changing shape through two processes called growth  (ossification) and modeling. In fact, in the first year of life, almost  100 percent of the bone tissue in the skeleton is replaced. In the  process of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built  up at a different site. In adulthood, our bones stop growing and  modeling, but continue to go through a process of bone remodeling.  In the process of remodeling, bone tissue is degraded and built up  at the same location. About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled  each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting  upon them, even in adulthood. This phenomenon is called Wolff’s  law, which states that bones will develop a structure that is best  able to resist the forces acting upon them. This is why exercising,  especially when it involves weight-bearing activities, increases bone  strength.  The first step in bone remodeling is osteocyte activation.  Osteocytes  detect  changes  in  mechanical  forces,  calcium  homeostasis, or hormone levels. In the second step, osteoclasts are  recruited to the site of the degradation. Osteoclasts are large cells  with a highly irregular ruffled membrane. These cells fuse tightly  to the bone and secrete hydrogen ions, which acidify the local  environment and dissolve the minerals in the bone tissue matrix.  This process is called bone resorption and resembles pit excavation.  Our bodies excavate pits in our bone tissue because bones act as  storehouses for calcium and other minerals.

Moreover,  if you decide to train to run a marathon your bones will restructure  themselves by remodeling to be better able to sustain the forces of  their new function.  After a certain amount of bone is excavated, the osteoclasts begin  to die and bone resorption stops. In the third step of bone  remodeling, the site is prepared for building. In this stage, sugars  and proteins accumulate along the bone’s surface, forming a cement  line which acts to form a strong bond between the old bone and  the new bone that will be made. These first three steps take  approximately two to three weeks to complete. In the last step of  bone remodeling, osteoblasts lay down new osteoid tissue that fills  up the cavities that were excavated during the resorption process.  Osteoid is bone matrix tissue that is composed of proteins such as  collagen and is not mineralized yet. To make collagen, vitamin C is  required. A symptom of vitamin C deficiency (known as scurvy) is  bone pain, which is caused by diminished bone remodeling. After  the osteoid tissue is built up, the bone tissue begins to mineralize.  The last step of bone remodeling continues for months, and for a  much longer time afterward the mineralized bone is continuously  packed in a more dense fashion.  Thus, we can say that bone is a living tissue that continually  adapts itself to mechanical stress through the process of  remodeling.

Similar  to measuring blood pressure to predict the risk of stroke, a BMD  measurement can help predict the risk of bone fracture. The most  common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray  absorptiometry (DEXA). During this procedure, a person lies on  their back and a DEXA scanner passes two X-ray beams through  their body. The amount of X-ray energy that passes through the  bone is measured for both beams. The total amount of the X-ray  energy that passes through a person varies depending on their bone  thickness. Using this information and a defined area of bone, the  amount of calcified tissue in grams per unit area (cm2) is calculated.  Most often the DEXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip  and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of  overall bone strength and health. DEXA is the cheapest and most  accurate way to measure BMD. It also uses the lowest dose of  radiation. Other methods of measuring BMD include quantitative  computed tomography (QCT) and radiographic absorptiometry.  People at risk for developing bone disease are advised to have a  DEXA scan. We will discuss the many risk factors linked to an  increased incidence of osteoporosis and the steps a person can take  to prevent the disease from developing.

Their jobs are to seek, recruit,  attack, and destroy foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses.  Other less realized components of the immune system are the skin  (which acts as a barricade), mucus (which traps and entangles  microorganisms), and even the bacteria in the large intestine (which  prevent the colonization of bad bacteria in the gut). Immune system  functions are completely dependent on dietary nutrients. In fact,  malnutrition is the leading cause of immune-system deficiency  worldwide. When immune system functions are inadequate there is  a marked increase in the chance of getting an infection. Children  in many poor, developing countries have protein- and/or energy- deficient diets that are causative of two different syndromes,  kwashiorkor and marasmus. These children often die from  infections that their bodies would normally have fought off, but  because their protein and/or energy intake is so low, the immune  system cannot perform its functions.  Other nutrients, such as iron, zinc, selenium, copper, folate, and  vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E, all provide benefits to immune system  function. Deficiencies in these nutrients can cause an increased risk  for infection and death. Zinc deficiency results in suppression of the  immune system’s barrier functions by damaging skin cells; it is also  associated with a decrease in the number of circulating white blood  cells.

Equally important to remember is that  multiple studies show that it is best to obtain your minerals and  vitamins from eating a variety of healthy foods.  Just as undernutrition compromises immune system health, so  does overnutrition. People who are obese are at increased risk for  developing immune system disorders such as asthma, rheumatoid  arthritis, and some cancers. Both the quality and quantity of fat  affect immune system function. High intakes of saturated and trans  fats negatively affect the immune system, whereas increasing your  intake of omega-3 fatty acids, found in salmon and other oily fish,  decreases inflammatory responses. High intakes of omega-3 fatty  acids are linked to a reduction in the risk of developing certain  autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and are used  as part of a comprehensive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.  1.\\xa0Aggarwal R, Sentz J, Miller MA.

The major physical factors  contributing to body weight are water weight, muscle tissue mass,  bone tissue mass, and fat tissue mass. Overweight refers to having  more weight than normal for a particular height and may be the  result of water weight, muscle weight, or fat mass. Obese refers  specifically to having excess body fat. In most cases people who are  overweight also have excessive body fat and therefore body weight  is an indicator of obesity in much of the population.  The “ideal” healthy body weight for a particular person is  dependent on many things, such as frame size, sex, muscle mass,  bone density, age, and height. The perception of the “ideal” body  weight is additionally dependent on cultural factors and the  mainstream societal advertisement of beauty.  To standardize the “ideal” body weight and relate it to health,  scientists have devised mathematical formulas to better define a  healthy weight. These mathematically derived measurements are  used by health professionals to correlate disease risk with  populations of people and at the individual level. A clinician will take  two measurements, one of weight and one of fat mass, in order to  diagnose obesity.

BMI Limitations  A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account  fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional  predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass.  Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body  fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more  muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more  muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary  individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular  athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more  overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is  an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older  person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower  BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis,  even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass.  BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly  correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to  diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.

Having more fat mass may be indicative of disease  risk, but fat mass also varies with sex, age, and physical activity  level. Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction  and, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones. The  optimal fat content of a female is between 20 and 30 percent of  her total weight and for a male is between 12 and 20 percent. Fat  mass can be measured in a variety of ways. The simplest and lowest- cost way is the skin-fold test. A health professional uses a caliper to  measure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of  the body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness. It is  a noninvasive and fairly accurate method of measuring fat mass, but  similar to BMI, is compared to standards of mostly young to middle- aged adults.

A human body is made up of mostly water.  An adult consists of about 37 to 42 liters of water, or about eighty  pounds. Fortunately, humans have compartmentalized tissues;  otherwise we might just look like a water balloon! Newborns are  approximately 70 percent water. Adult males typically are composed  of about 60 percent water and females are about 55 percent water.  (This gender difference reflects the differences in body-fat content,  since body fat is practically water-free. This also means that if a  person gains weight in the form of fat the percentage of total body  water content declines.) As we age, total body water content also  diminishes so that by the time we are in our eighties the percent  of water in our bodies has decreased to around 45 percent. Does  the loss in body water play a role in the aging process? Alas, no  one knows. But, we do know that dehydration accelerates the aging  process whereas keeping hydrated decreases headaches, muscle  aches, and kidney stones. Additionally a study conducted at the Fred  Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that women  who drank more than five glasses of water each day had a  significantly decreased risk for developing colon cancer.1  1.\\xa0Shannon JE, et al.

The  processes involved keep fluids from becoming too dilute or too  concentrated. Fluid compartments are separated by selectively  permeable membranes, which allow some things, such as water,  to move through while other substances require special transport  proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water  between fluid compartments happens by osmosis, which is simply  the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane  from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it  is not so concentrated. Water is never transported actively; that is,  it never takes energy for water to move between compartments.  Although cells do not directly control water movement, they do  control movement of electrolytes and other solutes and thus  indirectly regulate water movement by controlling where there will  be regions of high and low concentrations.  Cells maintain their water volume at a constant level, but the  composition of solutes in a cell is in a continuous state of flux.  This is because cells are bringing nutrients in, metabolizing them,  and disposing of waste products. To maintain water balance a cell  controls the movement of electrolytes to keep the total number of  dissolved particles, called osmolality the same inside and outside  (Figure 3.3 “Osmoregulation”). The total number of dissolved  substances is the same inside and outside a cell, but the  composition of the fluids differs between compartments.

Three conditions are shown: hypertonic conditions (where  the erythrocytes contract and appear “spiky”), isotonic conditions  (where the erythrocytes appear normal) and hypotonic conditions  (where the etrythrocytes expand and become more round).  If a cell is placed in a solution that contains fewer dissolved  particles (hypotonic solution) than the cell itself, water moves into  the more concentrated cell, causing it to swell. Alternatively, if a  cell is placed in a solution that is more concentrated (known as a  hypertonic solution) water moves from inside the cell to the outside,  causing it to shrink.

Molecules dissolve in water  because of the hydrogen and oxygen molecules ability to loosely  bond with other molecules. Molecules of water (H2O) surround  substances, suspending them in a sea of water molecules. The  solvent action of water allows for substances to be more readily  transported. A pile of undissolved salt would be difficult to move  throughout tissues, as would a bubble of gas or a glob of fat. Blood,  the primary transport fluid in the body is about 78 percent water.  Dissolved substances in blood include proteins, lipoproteins,  glucose, electrolytes, and metabolic waste products, such as carbon  dioxide and urea. These substances are either dissolved in the  watery surrounding of blood to be transported to cells to support  basic functions or are removed from cells to prevent waste build- up and toxicity. Blood is not just the primary vehicle of transport in  the body, but also as a fluid tissue blood structurally supports blood  vessels that would collapse in its absence.

Human life  is supported within a narrow range of temperature, with the  temperature set point of the body being 98.6°F (37°C). Too low or  too high of a temperature causes enzymes to stop functioning and  metabolism is halted. At 82.4°F (28°C) muscle failure occurs and  hypothermia sets in. At the opposite extreme of 111.2°F (44°C) the  central nervous system fails and death results. Water is good at  storing heat, an attribute referred to as heat capacity and thus helps  maintain the temperature set point of the body despite changes in  the surrounding environment.  There are several mechanisms in place that move body water  from place to place as a method to distribute heat in the body and  equalize body temperature (Figure 3.4 “Thermoregulatory Center”).  The hypothalamus in the brain is the thermoregulatory center. The  hypothalamus contains special protein sensors that detect blood  temperature. The skin also contains temperature sensors that  respond quickly to changes in immediate surroundings. In response  to cold sensors in the skin, a neural signal is sent to the  hypothalamus, which then sends a signal to smooth muscle tissue  surrounding blood vessels causing them to constrict and reduce  blood flow. This reduces heat lost to the environment. The  hypothalamus also sends signals to muscles to erect hairs and shiver  and to endocrine glands like the thyroid to secrete hormones  capable of ramping up metabolism. These actions increase heat  conservation and stimulate its production in the body in response  to cooling temperatures.

Blood osmolality is primarily driven by the concentration  of sodium cations. The urge to drink results from a complex  interplay of hormones and neuronal responses that coordinate to  increase water input and contribute toward fluid balance and  composition in the body. The “thirst center” is contained within  the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain that lies just above the  brainstem. In older people the thirst mechanism is not as responsive  and as we age there is a higher risk for dehydration. Thirst happens  in the following sequence of physiological events:  1. Receptor proteins in the kidney, heart, and hypothalamus  detect decreased fluid volume or increased sodium  concentration in the blood.  2. Hormonal and neural messages are relayed to the brain’s thirst  center in the hypothalamus.  The hypothalamus sends neural signals to higher sensory areas  in the cortex of the brain, stimulating the conscious thought to  drink.  3. Fluids are consumed.  4. Receptors in the mouth and stomach detect mechanical  movements involved with fluid ingestion.  5. Neural signals are sent to the brain and the thirst mechanism  is shut off.  The physiological control of thirst is the backup mechanism to  increase water input. Fluid intake is controlled primarily by  conscious eating and drinking habits dependent on social and  cultural influences. For example, you might have a habit of drinking  a glass of orange juice and eating a bowl of cereal every morning  before school or work.  166  |  Regulation of Water Balance'},\n",

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.

Similarly, when an electrolyte at higher concentration in  the extracellular fluid is transported into a cell, the potential energy  is harnessed and used to perform work.  Cells are constantly transporting nutrients in and wastes out.  How is the concentration of solutes maintained if they are in a  state of flux? This is where electrolytes come into play. The cell  (or more specifically the numerous sodium-potassium pumps in  its membrane) continuously pumps sodium ions out to establish  a chemical gradient. The transport protein, called the glucose  symporter, uses the sodium gradient to power glucose movement  into the cell. Sodium and glucose both move into the cell. Water  passively follows the sodium. To restore balance, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium back to the extracellular fluid and  water follows. Every cycle of the sodium-potassium pump involves  the movement of three sodium ions out of a cell, in exchange for  two potassium ions into a cell. To maintain charge neutrality on the  outside of cells every sodium cation is followed by a chloride anion.  Every cycle of the pump costs one molecule of ATP (adenosine  triphosphate). The constant work of the sodium-potassium pump  maintains the solute  equilibrium  and consequently, water  distribution between intracellular and extracellular fluids.  The unequal movement of the positively charged sodium and  potassium ions makes intracellular fluid more negatively charged  than the extracellular fluid. This charge gradient is another source  of energy that a cell uses to perform work. You will soon learn  that this charge gradient and the sodium-potassium pump are also  essential for nerve conduction and muscle contraction.

In contrast to many minerals,  sodium absorption in the small intestine is extremely efficient and  in a healthy individual all excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys.  In fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200  milligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium. Kidney  reabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a  relatively constant sodium concentration in the blood.  Other Functions of Sodium in the Body  The second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse  transmission. Nerve impulse transmission results from the  transport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge  difference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular  environment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium  current moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction  also involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion  movements.  Sodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine  and also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney. Amino acids,  glucose and water must make their way from the small intestine to  the blood. To do so, they pass through intestinal cells on their way  to the blood.

Sweat  is mostly water but also contains some electrolytes, mostly sodium  and chloride. Under normal environmental conditions (i.e., not hot,  humid days) water and sodium loss through sweat is negligible,  but is highly variable among individuals. It is estimated that sixty  minutes of high-intensity physical activity, like playing a game of  tennis, can produce approximately one liter of sweat; however the  amount of sweat produced is highly dependent on environmental  conditions. A liter of sweat typically contains between 1 and 2 grams  of sodium and therefore exercising for multiple hours can result in a  high amount of sodium loss in some people. Additionally, hard labor  can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case,  the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal.  In athletes hyponatremia, or a low blood-sodium level, is not  so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather  drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium  concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and  diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia. The symptoms of  hyponatremia, also called water intoxication (since it is often the  root cause) include nausea, muscle cramps, confusion, dizziness,  and in severe cases, coma and death.

Salt Substitutes  For those with hypertension or those looking for a way to decrease  salt use, using a salt substitute for food preparation is one option.  However, many salt substitutes still contain sodium, just in lesser  amounts than table salt. Also, remember that most salt in the diet is  not from table-salt use, but from processed foods. Salt substitutes  often replace the sodium with potassium. People with kidney  disorders often have problems getting rid of excess potassium in the  diet and are advised to avoid salt substitutes containing potassium.  People with liver disorders should also avoid salt substitutes  containing potassium because their treatment is often accompanied  by potassium dysregulation.

Ninety percent of potassium exists in intracellular fluid, with  about 10 percent in extracellular fluid, and only 1 percent in blood  plasma. As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly  regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls  potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play  a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal  glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting  ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number  of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more  potassium is excreted. Because potassium is required for  maintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200  milligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day.  Other Functions of Potassium in the Body  Nerve impulse involves not only sodium, but also potassium. A nerve  impulse moves along a nerve via the movement of sodium ions into  the cell. To end the impulse, potassium ions rush out of the nerve  cell, thereby decreasing the positive charge inside the nerve cell.  This diminishes the stimulus. To restore the original concentrations  of ions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium ions out in exchange for  potassium  ions  in.  On  completion  of  the  restored  ion  concentrations, a nerve cell is now ready to receive the next  impulse.

The signs and symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps,  respiratory distress, and constipation. Severe potassium depletion  can cause the heart to have abnormal contractions and can even  be fatal. High levels of potassium in the blood, or hyperkalemia,  also affects the heart.

Dehydration can be caused  by prolonged physical activity without adequate water intake, heat  exposure, excessive weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, blood loss,  infectious diseases, malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and very  high glucose levels. Physiologically, dehydration decreases blood  volume. The water in cells moves into the blood to compensate  for the low blood-volume, and cells shrink. Signs and symptoms  of dehydration include thirst, dizziness, fainting, headaches, low  blood-pressure, fatigue, low to no urine output, and, in extreme  cases, loss of consciousness and death. Signs and symptoms are  usually noticeable after about 2 percent of total body water is lost.  Chronic dehydration is linked to higher incidences of some  diseases. There is strong evidence that low-hydration status  increases the risk for kidney stones and exercise-induced asthma.  There is also some scientific evidence that chronic dehydration  increases the risk for kidney disease, heart disease, and the  development of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes. Older  people often suffer from chronic dehydration as their thirst  mechanism is no longer as sensitive as it used to be.  Heat Stroke  Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the  body temperature is greater than 104°F (40°C). It is the result of  the body being unable to sufficiently cool itself by thermoregulatory  mechanisms. Dehydration is a primary cause of heat stroke as there  are not enough fluids in the body to maintain adequate sweat  production, and cooling of the body is impaired.

It is reported as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure,  which is the greatest and least pressure on an artery that occurs  with each heartbeat. The force of blood against an artery is  measured with a device called a sphygmomanometer. The results  are recorded in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. A desirable blood  pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg.

About  15 percent of Americans obtain drinking water from private wells,  which are not subject to EPA standards.  Producing water safe for drinking involves some or all of the  following processes: screening out large objects, removing excess  calcium carbonate from hard water sources, flocculation, which  adds a precipitating agent to remove solid particles, clarification,  sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. These processes aim to  remove unhealthy substances and produce high-quality, colorless,  odorless, good-tasting water.  Most drinking water is disinfected by the process of chlorination,  which involves adding chlorine compounds to the water.  Chlorination is cheap and effective at killing bacteria. However, it is  less effective at removing protozoa, such as Giardia lamblia.  Chlorine-resistant protozoa and viruses are instead removed by  extensive filtration methods.

Health Benefits  The most renowned effects of caffeine on the body are increased  alertness and delay of fatigue and sleep. How does caffeine  stimulate the brain? Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in  our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific  protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects  the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase  in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the  brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep.  At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and  interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as  shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia. People’s sensitivity to the adverse  effects of caffeine varies and some people develop side effects at  much lower doses. The many effects caffeine has on the brain do  not diminish with habitual drinking of caffeinated beverages.  Tools for Change  Consuming caffeine in the evening and in the middle of the night  will help keep you awake to study for an exam, but it will not  enhance your performance on the next day’s test if you do not get  enough sleep. Drink caffeinated beverages in moderation at any  time of the day or evening to increase alertness (if you are not  sensitive to caffeine’s adverse effects), but get the recommended  amount of sleep.  It is important to note that caffeine has some effects on health  that are either promoted or masked by the other beneficial  218  |  Popular Beverage Choices'},\n",

Some have hypothesized that caffeine elevates calcium excretion  and therefore could potentially harm bones. The scientific  consensus at this time is that caffeine minimally affects calcium  levels and intake is not associated with any increased risk for  osteoporosis or the incidence of fractures in most women. Although  the effect of caffeine on calcium excretion is small, postmenopausal  women with risk factors for osteoporosis may want to make sure  their dietary caffeine intake is low or moderate and not excessive.  The Caffeine Myth  A diuretic refers to any substance that elevates the normal urine  output above that of drinking water. Caffeinated beverages are  commonly believed to be dehydrating due to their diuretic effect,  but results from scientific studies do not support that caffeinated  beverages increase urine output more so than water. This does not  mean that consuming caffeinated beverages does not affect urine  output, but rather that it does not increase urine output more than  water does. Thus, caffeinated beverages are considered a source of  hydration similar to water.  Sports Drinks  Scientific  studies  under  certain  circumstances  show  that  consuming sports drinks (instead of plain water) during high- intensity exercise lasting longer than one hour significantly  enhances endurance, and some evidence indicates it additionally  enhances performance.

A well-concocted sports drink contains  sugar, water, and sodium in the correct proportions so that  hydration is optimized. The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood- glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete  hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces  some of that lost in sweat. The American College of Sports Medicine  states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent  dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance.  The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity  is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many  factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and  type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal  endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by  measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in  weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.  The primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium. One liter of sweat  can contain between 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium. Potassium,  magnesium, and calcium are also lost, but in much lower amounts. If  you are exercising at high intensity for greater than ninety minutes,  it is important to replace sodium as well as water. This can be partly  accomplished by consuming a sports drink. The highest content of  sodium in commercial sports drinks is approximately 450 milligrams  per liter and thus will not replace all lost sodium unless a person  drinks several liters. This is NOT recommended, as water  intoxication not only compromises performance, but may also be  deadly. The sodium in sports drinks enhances fluid absorption so  that rehydration is more efficiently accomplished. If you are not  exercising for more than ninety minutes at a high intensity, dietary  intake of sodium and other electrolytes should be sufficient for  replacing lost electrolytes.

Children and adult athletes exercising for more than one hour at  high-intensity (tennis, rowing, rugby, soccer, etc.) may benefit  endurance-wise and possibly performance-wise from consuming a  sports drink rather than water. However, consuming sports drinks  provides no benefit over water to endurance, performance, or  exercise recovery for those exercising less than an hour. In fact, as  with all other sugary drinks containing few to no nutrients, they are  only another source of calories. Drinking sports drinks when you  are doing no exercise at all is not recommended.  Sports Drink Alternatives  Instead of a sports drink, you can replenish lost fluids and obtain  energy and electrolytes during exercise by drinking plain water and  eating a sports bar or snack that contains carbohydrates, protein,  and electrolytes. Post-exercise, low-fat milk has been scientifically  shown to be just as effective as a sports drink as a rehydration  beverage and it is more nutrient-dense, containing carbohydrates,  protein, and electrolytes, in addition to other vitamins.  The Bottom Line  Sports drinks consumed in excess by athletes or used by non- athletes simply are another source of added sugars, and thus extra  calories, in the diet and provide no performance, exercise recovery  or health benefit.  224  |  Popular Beverage Choices'},\n",

There are  two main groups of polysaccharides: starches and fibers.  Starches  Starch molecules are found in abundance in grains, legumes, and  root vegetables, such as potatoes. Amylose, a plant starch, is a linear  chain containing hundreds of glucose units. Amylopectin, another  plant starch, is a branched chain containing thousands of glucose  units. These large starch molecules form crystals and are the  energy-storing molecules of plants. These two starch molecules  (amylose and amylopectin) are contained together in foods, but the  smaller one, amylose, is less abundant. Eating raw foods containing  starches provides very little energy as the digestive system has a  hard time breaking them down. Cooking breaks down the crystal  structure of starches, making them much easier to break down  in the human body. The starches that remain intact throughout  digestion are called resistant starches. Bacteria in the gut can break  some of these down and may benefit gastrointestinal health.  Isolated and modified starches are used widely in the food industry  and during cooking as food thickeners.  Figure 4.4 Structures of the Plant Starches and Glycogen  Introduction  |  235'},\n",

Lignin, however, is not composed of  carbohydrate units. Humans do not produce the enzymes that can  break down dietary fiber; however, bacteria in the large intestine  (colon) do.

Some examples of soluble fibers are inulin, pectin, and guar gum  and they are found in peas, beans, oats, barley, and rye. Cellulose  and lignin are insoluble fibers and a few dietary sources of them  are whole-grain foods, flax, cauliflower, and avocados. Cellulose is  the most abundant fiber in plants, making up the cell walls and  providing structure. Soluble fibers are more easily accessible to  bacterial enzymes in the large intestine so they can be broken down  to a greater extent than insoluble fibers, but even some breakdown  of cellulose and other insoluble fibers occurs.  The last class of fiber is functional fiber. Functional fibers have  been added to foods and have been shown to provide health  benefits to humans. Functional fibers may be extracted from plants  and purified or synthetically made. An example of a functional fiber  is psyllium-seed husk. Scientific studies show that consuming  psyllium-seed husk reduces blood-cholesterol levels and this health  claim has been approved by the FDA.

Chewing, also known as mastication, crumbles the  carbohydrate foods into smaller and smaller pieces. The salivary  glands in the oral cavity secrete saliva that coats the food particles.  Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks  the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides,  oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down  amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called  dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the  mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown  of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness. Only  about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth. (This  is a good thing as more glucose in the mouth would lead to more  tooth decay.) When carbohydrates reach the stomach no further  chemical breakdown occurs because the amylase enzyme does not  function in the acidic conditions of the stomach. But mechanical  breakdown is ongoing—the strong peristaltic contractions of the  stomach mix the carbohydrates into the more uniform mixture of  chyme.

The type of carbohydrate within a food affects the GI along with  its fat and fiber content. Increased fat and fiber in foods increases  the time required for digestion and delays the rate of gastric  emptying into the small intestine which, ultimately reduces the GI.  Processing and cooking also affects a food’s GI by increasing their  digestibility. Advancements in the technologies of food processing  and the high consumer demand for convenient, precooked foods in  the United States has created foods that are digested and absorbed  more rapidly, independent of the fiber content. Modern breakfast  cereals, breads, pastas, and many prepared foods have a high GI.  In contrast, most raw foods have a lower GI. (However, the more  ripened a fruit or vegetable is, the higher its GI.)  The GI can be used as a guide for choosing healthier carbohydrate  choices but has some limitations. The first is GI does not take into  account the amount of carbohydrates in a portion of food, only the  type of carbohydrate. Another is that combining low- and high-GI  foods changes the GI for the meal. Also, some nutrient-dense foods  have higher GIs than less nutritious food. (For instance, oatmeal has  a higher GI than chocolate because the fat content of chocolate is  higher.) Lastly, meats and fats do not have a GI since they do not  contain carbohydrates.  250  |  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates'},\n",

They are energy production, energy storage, building  macromolecules, sparing protein, and assisting in lipid metabolism.  Energy Production  The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells  in the body. Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus  other compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood  cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The  brain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because  it uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under  extreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose  entering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back  into the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy  remove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their  membranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical  bonds between the carbon atoms.

Prolonged muscle use (such as exercise for longer than a few  hours) can deplete the glycogen energy reserve. Remember that this  is referred to as “hitting the wall” or “bonking” and is characterized  by fatigue and a decrease in exercise performance. The weakening  of muscles sets in because it takes longer to transform the chemical  energy in fatty acids and proteins to usable energy than glucose.  After prolonged exercise, glycogen is gone and muscles must rely  more on lipids and proteins as an energy source. Athletes can  increase their glycogen reserve modestly by reducing training  intensity and increasing their carbohydrate intake to between 60  and 70 percent of total calories three to five days prior to an event.  People who are not hardcore training and choose to run a  5-kilometer race for fun do not need to consume a big plate of  pasta prior to a race since without long-term intense training the  adaptation of increased muscle glycogen will not happen.  The liver, like muscle, can store glucose energy as a glycogen,  but in contrast to muscle tissue it will sacrifice its stored glucose  energy to other tissues in the body when blood glucose is low.  Approximately one-quarter of total body glycogen content is in the  liver (which is equivalent to about a four-hour supply of glucose)  but this is highly dependent on activity level. The liver uses this  glycogen reserve as a way to keep blood-glucose levels within a  narrow range between meal times.

Adequate glucose levels in the blood also prevent the  development of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic condition resulting  from an elevation of ketone bodies in the blood. Ketone bodies are  an alternative energy source that cells can use when glucose supply  is insufficient, such as during fasting. Ketone bodies are acidic and  high elevations in the blood can cause it to become too acidic. This  is rare in healthy adults, but can occur in alcoholics, people who  are malnourished, and in individuals who have Type 1 diabetes. The  minimum amount of carbohydrate in the diet required to inhibit  ketosis in adults is 50 grams per day.  Carbohydrates  are  critical  to  support  life’s  most  basic  function—the production of energy. Without energy none of the  other life processes are performed. Although our bodies can  synthesize glucose it comes at the cost of protein destruction. As  with all nutrients though, carbohydrates are to be consumed in  moderation as having too much or too little in the diet may lead to  health problems.

An infatuation with  sugary foods and refined grains likely contributes to the epidemic  proportion of people who are overweight or obese in this country,  but so do the consumption of high-calorie foods that contain too  much saturated fat and the sedentary lifestyle of most Americans.

The Most Notorious Sugar  Before high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) was marketed as the best  food and beverage sweetener, sucrose (table sugar) was the  number-one sweetener in America. (Recall that sucrose, or table  sugar, is a disaccharide consisting of one glucose unit and one  fructose unit.) HFCS also contains the simple sugars fructose and  glucose, but with fructose at a slightly higher concentration. In  the production of HFCS, corn starch is broken down to glucose,  and some of the glucose is then converted to fructose. Fructose  is sweeter than glucose; hence many food manufacturers choose  to sweeten foods with HFCS. HFCS is used as a sweetener for  carbonated beverages, condiments, cereals, and a great variety of  other processed foods.  Some scientists, public health personnel, and healthcare  providers believe that fructose is the cause of the obesity epidemic  and its associated health consequences. The majority of their  evidence stems from the observation that since the early 1970s  the number of overweight or obese Americans has dramatically  increased and so has the consumption of foods containing HFCS.  However, as discussed, so has the consumption of added sugars  in general. Animal studies that fuel the fructose opponents show  fructose is not used to produce energy in the body; instead it is  mostly converted to fat in the liver—potentially contributing to  insulin resistance and the development of Type 2 diabetes.  Additionally, fructose does not stimulate the release of certain  appetite-suppressing hormones, like insulin, as glucose does.

Now that we know the benefits of eating the right  carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to  promote health and prevent disease.  How Many Carbohydrates Does a Person Need?  The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended  Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults  at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the  brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient  Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and  65 percent of your total caloric daily intake. This means that on  a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225  and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM  not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come  from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA  recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less  of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes  for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women,  respectively. The recommendations for dietary fiber are based upon  the intake levels known to prevent against heart disease.

It’s the Whole Nutrient Package  In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are  those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential  nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense  carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain  breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and  beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly  processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks,  cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie  carbohydrates.  They  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‘bad  carbohydrates,’ as they are known to cause health problems when  consumed in excess.  Understanding Carbohydrates from Product  Information  While nutrition facts labels aid in determining the amount of  carbohydrates you eat, they do not help in determining whether  a food is refined or not. The ingredients list provides some help  in this regard. It identifies all of the food’s ingredients in order of  concentration, with the most concentrated ingredient first. When  choosing between two breads, pick the one that lists whole wheat  (not wheat flour) as the first ingredient, and avoid those with other  flour ingredients, such as white flour or corn flour. (Enriched wheat  flour refers to white flour with added vitamins.)

The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommends eating  more unrefined carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing  consumption of foods that are high in added sugars. To accomplish  these recommendations use some or all of the following  suggestions:  • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by  eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain  bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of  beans and/or nuts with dinner.  • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the  grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole  grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of  whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown  rice, or whole-wheat pasta.  Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so  choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal  listed as the first ingredient.  • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour.  • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a  Kaiser roll or baguette.  Add beans, nuts, or seeds to salad—they add texture and taste.  • Choose whole-grain pastas and brown rice, cook al dente, and  add some beans and vegetables in equal portions.  • Change it up a bit and experience the taste and satisfaction of  other whole grains such as barley, quinoa, and bulgur.  • Eat snacks high in fiber, such as almonds, pistachios, raisins,  and air-popped popcorn.

The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of  Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes  In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing  carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of  functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk,  coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning  capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the  different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods.  Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making  jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses,  and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture  to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases  bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but  also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the  combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as  a glossy appearance and smooth texture.  Due to the potential health consequences of consuming too many  added sugars, sugar substitutes have replaced them in many foods  and beverages. Sugar substitutes may be from natural sources or  artificially made. Those that are artificially made are called artificial  sweeteners and must be approved by the FDA for use in foods  and beverages. The artificial sweeteners approved by the FDA are  saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, neotame, advantame,  and sucralose. Stevia is an example of a naturally derived sugar  substitute.

Sugar alcohols, such as xylitol,  sorbitol, erythritol, and mannitol, are sugar alcohols that occur  naturally in some fruits and vegetables. However, they are  industrially synthesized with yeast and other microbes for use as  food additives. The FDA requires that foods disclose the fact that  they contain sugar alcohols, but does not require scientific testing  of it. (Though many of them have undergone studies anyway.) In  comparison to sucrose, artificial sweeteners are significantly  sweeter (in fact, by several hundred times), but sugar alcohols are  more often less sweet than sucrose (see Table 4.5 “Relative  Sweetness of Sugar Substitutes”). Artificial sweeteners and Stevia  are not digested or absorbed in significant amounts and therefore  are not a significant source of calories in the diet.

Artificial sweeteners are basically non-nutrients  though not all are completely calorie-free. However, because they  are so intense in sweetness they are added in very small amounts  to foods and beverages. Artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols are  not “fermentable sugars” and therefore they do not cause tooth  decay. Chewing gum with artificial sweeteners is the only proven  way that artificial sweeteners promote oral health. The American  Dental Association (ADA) allows manufacturers of chewing gum to  label packages with an ADA seal if they have convincing scientific  evidence demonstrating their product either reduces plaque acids,  cavities, or gum disease, or promotes tooth remineralization.  There is limited scientific evidence that consuming products with  artificial sweeteners decreases weight. In fact, some studies suggest  the intense sweetness of these products increases appetite for  sweet foods and may lead to increased weight gain. Also, there  is very limited evidence that suggests artificial sweeteners lower  blood-glucose levels. Additionally, many foods and beverages  containing artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols are still empty- calorie foods (i.e. chewing sugarless gum or drinking diet soda pop)  are not going to better your blood-glucose levels or your health.

The health concerns of sugar substitutes  originally  stemmed  from  scientific  studies,  which  were  misinterpreted by both scientists and the public.  In the early 1970s scientific studies were published that  demonstrated that high doses of saccharin caused bladder tumors  in rats. This information fueled the still-ongoing debate of the  health consequences of all artificial sweeteners. In actuality, the  results from the early studies were completely irrelevant to humans.  The large doses (2.5 percent of diet) of saccharine caused a pellet  to form in the rat’s bladder. That pellet chronically irritated the  bladder wall, eventually resulting in tumor development. Since this  study, scientific investigation in rats, monkeys, and humans have  not found any relationship between saccharine consumption and  bladder cancer. In 2000, saccharin was removed from the US  National Toxicology Program’s list of potential carcinogens.1  There have been health concerns over other artificial sweeteners,  most notably aspartame (sold under the trade names of NutraSweet  and Equal). The first misconception regarding aspartame was that  it was linked with an increase in the incidence of brain tumors in  the United States. It was subsequently discovered that the increase  in brain tumors started eight years prior to the introduction of  aspartame to the market. Today, aspartame is accused of causing  brain damage, autism, emotional disorders, and a myriad of other  disorders and diseases. Some even believe aspartame is part of a  governmental conspiracy to make people dumber.

So, normal fat reserves are a signal that metabolic processes  are efficient and a person is healthy.  Lipids are a family of organic compounds that are mostly insoluble  in water. Composed of fats and oils, lipids are molecules that yield  high energy and have a chemical composition mainly of carbon,  hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids perform three primary biological  functions within the body: they serve as structural components of  cell membranes, function as energy storehouses, and function as  important signaling molecules.  The three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids,  and sterols. Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids  in the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil,  butter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats.  Naturally occurring triglycerides are found in many foods, including  avocados, olives, corn, and nuts. We commonly call the triglycerides  in our food “fats” and “oils.” Fats are lipids that are solid at room  temperature, whereas oils are liquid. As with most fats, triglycerides  do not dissolve in water. The terms fats, oils, and triglycerides are  discretionary and can be used interchangeably. In this chapter when  we use the word fat, we are referring to triglycerides.  Phospholipids make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids.  They are water-soluble and are found in both plants and animals.  Phospholipids are crucial for building the protective barrier, or  membrane, around your body’s cells. In fact, phospholipids are  synthesized in the body to form cell and organelle membranes. In  blood and body fluids, phospholipids form structures in which fat is  enclosed and transported throughout the bloodstream.  Sterols are the least common type of lipid. Cholesterol is perhaps  the best well-known sterol. Though cholesterol has a notorious  reputation, the body gets only a small amount of its cholesterol  through food—the body produces most of it. Cholesterol is an  important component of the cell membrane and is required for the  synthesis of sex hormones, and bile salts.  Introduction  |  293'},\n",

Most of the energy  required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and  lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates chapter, glucose is stored  in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of  energy, lipids primarily function as an energy reserve. As you may  recall, glycogen is quite bulky with heavy water content, thus the  body cannot store too much for long. Alternatively, fats are packed  together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of  energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with  energy—it contains more than double the amount of energy than a  gram of carbohydrate. Energy is needed to power the muscles for  all the physical work and play an average person or child engages in.  For instance, the stored energy in muscles propels an athlete down  the track, spurs a dancer’s legs to showcase the latest fancy steps,  and keeps all the moving parts of the body functioning smoothly.  Unlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat  cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost  indefinitely in size. An overabundance of adipose tissue can result  in undue stress on the body and can be detrimental to your health.  A serious impact of excess fat is the accumulation of too much  cholesterol in the arterial wall, which can thicken the walls of  arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease.

Aiding Digestion and Increasing Bioavailability  The dietary fats in the foods we eat break down in our digestive  systems and begin the transport of precious micronutrients. By  carrying fat-soluble nutrients through the digestive process,  intestinal absorption is improved. This improved absorption is also  known as increased bioavailability. Fat-soluble nutrients are  especially important for good health and exhibit a variety of  functions. Vitamins A, D, E, and K—the fat-soluble vitamins—are  mainly found in foods containing fat. Some fat-soluble vitamins  (such as vitamin A) are also found in naturally fat-free foods such  as green leafy vegetables, carrots, and broccoli. These vitamins are  best absorbed when combined with foods containing fat. Fats also  increase the bioavailability of compounds known as phytochemicals,  which are plant constituents such as lycopene (found in tomatoes)  and beta-carotene (found in carrots). Phytochemicals are believed  to promote health and well-being. As a result, eating tomatoes with  olive oil or salad dressing will facilitate lycopene absorption.

Foods that are  high in fat contain more calories than foods high in protein or  carbohydrates. As a result, high-fat foods are a convenient source  of energy. For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories  of energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of  carbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity  and on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person  to person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the  high-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing  children require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth  and development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for  an extended period, growth and development will not progress  normally. Other individuals with high-energy needs are athletes,  people who have physically demanding jobs, and those recuperating  from illness.  When the body has used all of its calories from carbohydrates  (this can occur after just twenty minutes of exercise), it initiates  fat usage. A professional swimmer must consume large amounts of  food energy to meet the demands of swimming long distances, so  eating fat-rich foods makes sense. In contrast, if a person who leads  a sedentary lifestyle eats the same high-density fat foods, they will  intake more fat calories than their body requires within just a few  bites. Use caution—consumption of calories over and beyond energy  requirements is a contributing factor to obesity.  The Role of Lipids in Food  |  301'},\n",

If each available carbon bond holds  a hydrogen atom we call this a saturated fatty acid chain. All carbon  atoms in such a fatty acid chain are bonded with single bonds.

When  the muscles reach their capacity for glycogen storage, the excess  is returned to the liver, where it is converted into triglycerides and  then stored as fat.  In a similar manner, much of the triglycerides the body receives  from food is transported to fat storehouses within the body if not  used for producing energy. The chylomicrons are responsible for  shuttling the triglycerides to various locations such as the muscles,  breasts, external layers under the skin, and internal fat layers of the  abdomen, thighs, and buttocks where they are stored by the body  in adipose tissue for future use. How is this accomplished? Recall  that chylomicrons are large lipoproteins that contain a triglyceride  and fatty-acid core. Capillary walls contain an enzyme called  lipoprotein-lipase  that  dismantles  the  triglycerides  in  the  lipoproteins into fatty acids and glycerol, thus enabling these to  enter into the adipose cells. Once inside the adipose cells, the fatty  acids and glycerol are reassembled into triglycerides and stored for  later use. Muscle cells may also take up the fatty acids and use them  for muscular work and generating energy. When a person’s energy  requirements exceed the amount of available fuel presented from a  recent meal or extended physical activity has exhausted glycogen  energy reserves, fat reserves are retrieved for energy utilization.  As the body calls for additional energy, the adipose tissue  responds by dismantling its triglycerides and dispensing glycerol  and fatty acids directly into the blood. Upon receipt of these  substances the energy-hungry cells break them down further into  tiny fragments. These fragments go through a series of chemical  reactions that yield energy, carbon dioxide, and water.  Figure 5.14 Storing and Using Fat  324  |  Digestion and Absorption of Lipids'},\n",

Following is  a list of the various lipoproteins and their functions:  • VLDLs. Very low-density lipoproteins are made in the liver  from remnants of chylomicrons and transport triglycerides  from the liver to various tissues in the body. As the VLDLs  travel through the circulatory system, the lipoprotein lipase  strips the VLDL of triglycerides. As triglyceride removal  persists, the VLDLs become intermediate-density lipoproteins.  • IDLs. Intermediate-density lipoproteins transport a variety of  fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream and are a little under  half triglyceride in composition. While travelling in the  bloodstream, cholesterol is gained from other lipoproteins  while circulating enzymes strip its phospholipid component.  When IDLs return to the liver, they are transformed into low- density lipoprotein.  • LDLs. As low-density lipoproteins are commonly known as the  “bad cholesterol” it is imperative that we understand their  function in the body so as to make healthy dietary and lifestyle  choices. LDLs carry cholesterol and other lipids from the liver  to tissue throughout the body. LDLs are comprised of very  small amounts of triglycerides, and house over 50 percent  cholesterol and cholesterol esters. How does the body receive  the lipids contained therein? As the LDLs deliver cholesterol  and other lipids to the cells, each cell’s surface has receptor  systems specifically designed to bind with LDLs. Circulating  LDLs in the bloodstream bind to these LDL receptors and are  consumed. Once inside the cell, the LDL is taken apart and its  cholesterol is released. In liver cells these receptor systems aid  in controlling blood cholesterol levels as they bind the LDLs. A  deficiency of these LDL binding mechanisms will leave a high  quantity of cholesterol traveling in the bloodstream, which can  lead to heart disease or atherosclerosis.

Also, our  bodies synthesize eicosanoids from omega-6 fatty acids and these  tend to increase inflammation, blood clotting, and cell proliferation,  while the hormones synthesized from omega-3 fatty acids have just  the opposite effect.  While omega-6 fatty acids are essential, they can be harmful  when they are out of balance with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6  fats are required only in small quantities. Researchers believe that  when omega-6 fats are out of balance with omega-3 fats in the  diet they diminish the effects of omega-3 fats and their benefits.

Do you think of heart disease, heart health, or  atherosclerosis? Most people probably do not. As we uncover what  hydrogenation is and why manufacturers use it, you will be better  equipped to adhere to healthier dietary choices and promote your  heart health.  Hydrogenation: The Good Gone Bad?  Food manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to  attack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation  render them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules  attack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes  oxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives  the food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can  undergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be  stored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to  minimize damage from oxidation. Hydrogenation poses a solution  that food manufacturers prefer.  When lipids are subjected to hydrogenation, the molecular  structure of the fat is altered. Hydrogenation is the process of  adding hydrogen to unsaturated fatty-acid chains, so that the  hydrogen atoms are connected to the points of saturation and  results in a more saturated fatty acid. Liquid oils that once  contained more unsaturated fatty acids become semisolid or solid  (upon complete hydrogenation) and behave like saturated fats.

When the process of  hydrogenation is not complete, for example, not all carbon double  bonds have been saturated the end result is a partially hydrogenated  oil. The resulting oil is not fully solid. Total hydrogenation makes  the oil very hard and virtually unusable. Some newer products are  now using fully hydrogenated oil combined with nonhydrogenated  vegetable oils to create a usable fat.  Manufacturers favor hydrogenation as a way to prevent oxidation  of oils and ensure longer shelf life. Partially hydrogenated vegetable  oils are used in the fast food and processed food industries because  they impart the desired texture and crispness to baked and fried  foods. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are more resistant to  breakdown from extremely hot cooking temperatures. Because  hydrogenated oils have a high smoking point they are very well  suited for frying. In addition, processed vegetable oils are cheaper  than fats obtained from animal sources, making them a popular  choice for the food industry.  Trans fatty acids occur in small amounts in nature, mostly in  dairy products. However, the trans fats that are used by the food  industry are produced from the hydrogenation process. Trans fats  are a result of the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids,  which cause them to have a trans configuration, rather than the  naturally occurring cis configuration.  Health Implications of Trans Fats  No trans fats! Zero trans fats! We see these advertisements on a  regular basis. So widespread is the concern over the issue that  restaurants, food manufacturers, and even fast-food establishments  proudly tout either the absence or the reduction of these fats within  their products.

Trans fats are used in many processed foods such as  cookies, cakes, chips, doughnuts, and snack foods to give them their  crispy texture and increased shelf life. However, because trans fats  can behave like saturated fats, the body processes them as if they  were saturated fats. Consuming large amounts of trans fats has been  associated with tissue inflammation throughout the body, insulin  resistance in some people, weight gain, and digestive troubles. In  addition, the hydrogenation process robs the person of the benefits  of consuming the original oil because hydrogenation destroys  omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The AHA states that, like  saturated fats, trans fats raise LDL “bad cholesterol,” but unlike  saturated fats, trans fats lower HDL “good cholesterol.” The AHA  advises limiting trans-fat consumption to less than 1 percent.  How can you benefit from this information?

This makes it possible to eat too much trans fat when you  think you’re not eating any at all because it is labeled trans-fat free.  Always review the label for trans fat per serving. Check the  ingredient list, especially the first three to four ingredients, for  telltale signs of hydrogenated fat such as partially or fractionated  hydrogenated oil. The higher up the words “partially hydrogenated  oil” are on the list of ingredients, the more trans fat the product  contains.  Measure out one serving and eat one serving only.

A Prelude to Disease  If left unchecked, improper dietary fat consumption can lead down  a path to severe health problems. An increased level of lipids,  triglycerides, and cholesterol in the blood is called hyperlipidemia.  Hyperlipidemia is inclusive of several conditions but more  commonly refers to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. When  blood lipid levels are high, any number of adverse health problems  may ensue. Consider the following:  • Cardiovascular disease. According to the AHA, cardiovascular  disease encompasses a variety of problems, many of which are  related to the process of atherosclerosis. Over time the  arteries thicken and harden with plaque buildup, causing  restricted or at times low or no blood flow to selected areas of  the body.  • Heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to a  section of the heart is cut off due to a blood clot. Many have  survived heart attacks and go on to return to their lives and  enjoy many more years of life on this earth. However, dietary  and lifestyle changes must be implemented to prevent further  attacks.  • Ischemic stroke. The most common type of stroke in the  United States, ischemic stroke, occurs when a blood vessel in  the brain or leading to the brain becomes blocked, again  usually from a blood clot.

This is an abnormal rhythm of the heart. The heart  may beat above one hundred beats per minute (known as  tachycardia) or below sixty beats per minute (known as  bradycardia), or the beats are not regular.

What You Can Do  Remember that saturated fats are found in large amounts in foods  of animal origin. They should be limited within the diet.  Polyunsaturated fats are generally obtained from non-animal  sources. While they are beneficial for lowering bad cholesterol they  also lower good cholesterol. They are better for you than saturated  fats but are not to be consumed in excess. Monounsaturated fats  are of plant origin and are found in most nuts, seeds, seed oils, olive  oil, canola oil, and legumes. Monounsaturated fats are excellent  because they not only lower bad cholesterol, but also they elevate  the good cholesterol. Replace current dietary fats with an increased  intake of monounsaturated fats.  Choose whole-grain and high-fiber foods. Reduced risk for  cardiovascular disease has been associated with diets that are high  in whole grains and fiber. Fiber also slows down cholesterol  absorption. The AHA recommends that at least half of daily grain  intake should originate from whole grains. The Adequate Intake  value for fiber is 14 grams per 1,000 kilocalories. These amounts  are based upon the amount of fiber that has been shown to reduce  cardiovascular risk.  Do not be sedentary. Get more exercise on a regular basis.  Increasing your energy expenditure by just twenty minutes of  physical activity at least three times per week will improve your  overall health.

For example, if selecting  prepared foods, choose the ones without high-fat sauces in  favor of adding your own flavorings. If selecting precooked  meats, avoid those that are fried, coated, or prepared in high- fat sauces. A popular and healthy precooked meat food choice  is the rotisserie chicken that most supermarkets carry.

Saturated and trans fats are not good for you and  must be placed in your “Least Desirable” column because they  increase cholesterol levels and put you at risk for heart  disease. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are better  choices to replace these undesirable fats. The key in  identifying the “Best” or “Better” fats from the “Least Desirable”  fats while you shop is based upon appearance. When choosing  fats remember that saturated fats and trans fats are solid at  room temperature; think of butter. Monounsaturated and  polyunsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature; think of  vegetable oil.  • Try to eliminate as much trans fat as possible from your food  selections. Avoid commercially baked goods and fast foods.  Make these your “Infrequent Foods.”  • Choose unsaturated fats. Fatty fish, walnuts, flaxseeds,  flaxseed oil, and canola oil all have good health benefits and  should be on the “Best,” “Better,” and “Good” fat lists.

Too  much of these ingredients can also cause health problems.  Choose and consume wisely.  • A “better-fat” diet will successfully support weight loss.  While cutting “Least Desirable” fat calories are vital to weight  loss, remember that “Better” fats are filling and just a handful  of nuts can curb an appetite to prevent overeating.  • Consume omega-3 fats each day. For optimal health and  disease prevention include a moderate serving of fish, walnuts,  ground flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, or soybean oil in your diet every  day.  • How much saturated fat is too much? Your goal is to keep  your intake of saturated fat to no more than 10 percent of your  total dietary calories on a daily basis. Thus, it is important to  learn to reduce the intake of foods high in saturated fat. High- fat foods can be consumed but they must fall within the overall  goal for a person’s fat allowance for the day.  • Home cooking. Limit the use of saturated fats in home  preparation of meals. Instead of butter try spreads made from  unsaturated oils such as canola or olive oils and the use of  cooking sprays. Couple this with the use of herbs and spices to  add flavor. Avoid using high-fat meat gravies, cheese, and  cream sauces. Limit adding extras to foods such as butter on a  baked potato. Use nonfat sour cream instead. Grill, bake, stir- fry, roast, or bake your foods. Never fry in solid fats such as  butter or shortening. Marinate foods to be grilled in fruit juices  and herbs. Instead of relying upon commercial salad dressings,  learn to make your own top-quality dressing from cold- pressed olive oil, flaxseed oil, or sesame oil.  • Make sure the fat is flavorful. Adding flavor to food is what  makes the eating experience enjoyable. Why not choose  unsaturated fats and oils that have strong flavors? In this way  you will add good flavor to your meals but use less fat in the  process. Some examples are sesame oil, peanut oil, and peanut  A Personal Choice about Lipids  |  353'},\n",

The word protein is a Greek word,  meaning “of utmost importance.” Proteins are called the workhorses  of life as they provide the body with structure and perform a vast  array of functions. You can stand, walk, run, skate, swim, and more  because of your protein-rich muscles. Protein is necessary for  proper immune system function, digestion, and hair and nail  growth, and is involved in numerous other body functions. In fact,  it is estimated that more than one hundred thousand different  proteins exist within the human body. In this chapter you will learn  about the components of protein, the important roles that protein  serves within the body, how the body uses protein, the risks and  consequences associated with too much or too little protein, and  where to find healthy sources of it in your diet.  What Is Protein?  Proteins, simply put, are macromolecules composed of amino acids.  Amino acids are commonly called protein’s building blocks. Proteins  are crucial for the nourishment, renewal, and continuance of life.  Proteins contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen just  as carbohydrates and lipids do, but proteins are the only  macronutrient that contains nitrogen. In each amino acid the  elements are arranged into a specific conformation around a carbon  center. Each amino acid consists of a central carbon atom  connected to a side chain, a hydrogen, a nitrogen-containing amino  group, and a carboxylic acid group—hence the name “amino acid.”  Defining Protein  |  363'},\n",

It’s All in the Side Chain  The side chain of an amino acid, sometimes called the “R” group, can  be as simple as one hydrogen bonded to the carbon center, or as  complex as a six-carbon ring bonded to the carbon center. Although  each side chain of the twenty amino acids is unique, there are some  chemical likenesses among them. Therefore, they can be classified  into four different groups.

Eleven of these are called nonessential amino acids because  the body can synthesize them. However, nine of the amino acids  are called essential amino acids because we cannot synthesize them  either at all or in sufficient amounts. These must be obtained from  the diet. Sometimes during infancy, growth, and in diseased states  the body cannot synthesize enough of some of the nonessential  amino acids and more of them are required in the diet.

The first step in  constructing a protein is the transcription (copying) of the genetic  information in double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into  the single-stranded, messenger macromolecule ribonucleic acid  (RNA). RNA is chemically similar to DNA, but has two differences;  one is that its backbone uses the sugar ribose and not deoxyribose;  and two, it contains the nucleotide base uracil, and not thymidine.  The RNA that is transcribed from a given piece of DNA contains the  same information as that DNA, but it is now in a form that can be  read by the cellular protein manufacturer known as the ribosome.  Next, the RNA instructs the cells to gather all the necessary amino  acids and add them to the growing protein chain in a very specific  order. This process is referred to as translation.

The peptide bond forms between the carboxylic acid group of one  amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing a molecule  of water. The third step in protein production involves folding it  into its correct shape. Specific amino acid sequences contain all  the information necessary to spontaneously fold into a particular  shape. A change in the amino acid sequence will cause a change in  protein shape. Each protein in the human body differs in its amino  acid sequence and consequently, its shape. The newly synthesized  protein is structured to perform a particular function in a cell.  A protein made with an incorrectly placed amino acid may not  function properly and this can sometimes cause disease.  Protein Organization  Protein’s structure enables it to perform a variety of functions.  Proteins are similar to carbohydrates and lipids in that they are  polymers of simple repeating units; however, proteins are much  more structurally complex. In contrast to carbohydrates, which  have identical repeating units, proteins are made up of amino acids  that are different from one another. Furthermore, a protein is  organized into four different structural levels.  Primary: The first level is the one-dimensional sequence of amino  acids that are held together by peptide bonds. Carbohydrates and  lipids also are one-dimensional sequences of their respective  monomers, which may be branched, coiled, fibrous, or globular, but  their conformation is much more random and is not organized by  their sequence of monomers.  Secondary: The second level of protein structure is dependent  on the chemical interactions between amino acids, which cause the  protein to fold into a specific shape, such as a helix (like a coiled  spring) or sheet.  370  |  Defining Protein'},\n",

As the different side chains of amino acids chemically  interact, they either repel or attract each other, resulting in the  folded structure. Thus, the specific sequence of amino acids in a  protein directs the protein to fold into a specific, organized shape.  Quaternary:\\xa0 The fourth level of structure is achieved when  protein fragments called peptides combine to make one larger  functional protein. The protein hemoglobin is an example of a  protein that has quaternary structure. It is composed of four  peptides that bond together to form a functional oxygen carrier.  A protein’s structure also influences its nutritional quality. Large  fibrous protein structures are more difficult to digest than smaller  proteins and some, such as keratin, are indigestible. Because  digestion of some fibrous proteins is incomplete, not all of the  amino acids are absorbed and available for the body to utilize,  thereby decreasing their nutritional value.

The  foam bubbles are what give the angel food cake its airy texture.)  Yogurt is another good example of proteins providing texture. Milk  proteins called caseins coagulate, increasing yogurt’s thickness.  Cooked proteins add some color and flavor to foods as the amino  group binds with carbohydrates and produces a brown pigment and  aroma. Eggs are between 10 and 15 percent protein by weight. Most  cake recipes use eggs because the egg proteins help bind all the  other ingredients together into a uniform cake batter. The proteins  aggregate into a network during mixing and baking that gives cake  structure.  374  |  The Role of Proteins in Foods: Cooking and Denaturation'},\n",

Denaturation  refers to the physical changes that take place in a protein exposed  to abnormal conditions in the environment. Heat, acid, high salt  concentrations, alcohol, and mechanical agitation can cause  proteins to denature. When a protein denatures, its complicated  folded structure unravels, and it becomes just a long strand of  amino acids again. Weak chemical forces that hold tertiary and  secondary protein structures together are broken when a protein  is exposed to unnatural conditions. Because proteins’ function is  dependent on their shape, denatured proteins are no longer  functional. During cooking the applied heat causes proteins to  vibrate. This destroys the weak bonds holding proteins in their  complex shape (though this does not happen to the stronger  peptide bonds). The unraveled protein strands then stick together,  forming an aggregate (or network).  The Role of Proteins in Foods: Cooking and Denaturation  |  375'},\n",

The teeth begin the  mechanical breakdown of the large egg pieces into smaller pieces  that can be swallowed. The salivary glands provide some saliva to  aid swallowing and the passage of the partially mashed egg through  the esophagus. The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach through  the esophageal sphincter. The stomach releases gastric juices  containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate  the breakdown of the protein. The acidity of the stomach facilitates  the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the  protein aggregates formed during cooking. Pepsin, which is  secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein  chains into smaller and smaller fragments. Egg proteins are large  globular molecules and their chemical breakdown requires time  and mixing. The powerful mechanical stomach contractions churn  the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture called  chyme. Protein digestion in the stomach takes a longer time than  carbohydrate digestion, but a shorter time than fat digestion. Eating  a high-protein meal increases the amount of time required to  sufficiently break down the meal in the stomach. Food remains in  the stomach longer, making you feel full longer.  From the Stomach to the Small Intestine  The stomach empties the chyme containing the broken down egg  pieces into the small intestine, where the majority of protein  digestion occurs.

The muscle  contractions of the small intestine mix and propel the digested  proteins to the absorption sites. In the lower parts of the small  intestine, the amino acids are transported from the intestinal lumen  through the intestinal cells to the blood. This movement of  individual amino acids requires special transport proteins and the  cellular energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Once the  amino acids are in the blood, they are transported to the liver. As  with other macronutrients, the liver is the checkpoint for amino  acid distribution and any further breakdown of amino acids, which  is very minimal. Recall that amino acids contain nitrogen, so further  catabolism of amino acids releases nitrogen-containing ammonia.  Because ammonia is toxic, the liver transforms it into urea, which  is then transported to the kidney and excreted in the urine. Urea  is a molecule that contains two nitrogens and is highly soluble in  water. This makes it a good choice for transporting excess nitrogen  out of the body. Because amino acids are building blocks that the  body reserves in order to synthesize other proteins, more than 90  percent of the protein ingested does not get broken down further  than the amino acid monomers.  Amino Acids Are Recycled  Just as some plastics can be recycled to make new products, amino  acids are recycled to make new proteins. All cells in the body  continually break down proteins and build new ones, a process  referred to as protein turnover. Every day over 250 grams of protein  in your body are dismantled and 250 grams of new protein are  built.

Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration  Proteins are involved in all aspects of wound healing, a process  that takes place in three phases: inflammatory, proliferative, and  remodeling. For example, if you were sewing and pricked your  finger with a needle, your flesh would turn red and become  inflamed. Within a few seconds bleeding would stop. The healing  process begins with proteins such as bradykinin, which dilate blood  vessels at the site of injury. An additional protein called fibrin helps  to secure platelets that form a clot to stop the bleeding. Next, in  the proliferative phase, cells move in and mend the injured tissue by  installing newly made collagen fibers. The collagen fibers help pull  the wound edges together. In the remodeling phase, more collagen  is deposited, forming a scar. Scar tissue is only about 80 percent  as functional as normal uninjured tissue. If a diet is insufficient in  protein, the process of wound healing is markedly slowed.  While wound healing takes place only after an injury is sustained,  a different process called tissue regeneration is ongoing in the body.  The  main  difference  between  wound  healing  and  tissue  regeneration is in the process of regenerating an exact structural  and functional copy of the lost tissue. Thus, old, dying tissue is  not replaced with scar tissue but with brand new, fully functional  tissue. Some cells (such as skin, hair, nails, and intestinal cells) have  a very high rate of regeneration, while others, (such as heart-muscle  Protein’s Functions in the Body  |  391'},\n",

In  a hair follicle, cells divide and a hair grows in length. Hair growth  averages 1 centimeter per month and fingernails about 1 centimeter  every one hundred days. The cells lining the intestine regenerate  every three to five days. Protein-inadequate diets impair tissue  regeneration, causing many health problems including impairment  of nutrient digestion and absorption and, most visibly, hair and nail  growth.  Energy Production  Some of the amino acids in proteins can be disassembled and used  to make energy (Figure 6.14 “Amino Acids Used for Energy”). Only  about 10 percent of dietary proteins are catabolized each day to  make cellular energy. The liver is able to break down amino acids  to the carbon skeleton, which can then be fed into the citric acid  cycle. This is similar to the way that glucose is used to make ATP. If a  person’s diet does not contain enough carbohydrates and fats their  body will use more amino acids to make energy, which compromises  the synthesis of new proteins and destroys muscle proteins.  Alternatively, if a person’s diet contains more protein than the body  needs, the extra amino acids will be broken down and transformed  into fat.  \\xa0 Figure 6.14 Amino Acids Used for Energy  392  |  Protein’s Functions in the Body'},\n",

A healthy diet  incorporates all nutrients in moderation. Low protein intake has  several health consequences, and a severe lack of protein in the  diet eventually causes death. Although severe protein deficiency is  a rare occurrence in children and adults in the United States, it  is estimated that more than half of the elderly in nursing homes  are protein-deficient. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution  Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent  of kilocalories, which is a fairly wide range. The percent of protein  in the diet that is associated with malnutrition and its health  consequences is less than 10 percent, but this is often accompanied  by deficiencies in calories and other micronutrients. In this section  we will discuss the health consequences of protein intake that is  either too low to support life’s processes or too high, thereby  increasing the risk of chronic disease. In the last section of this  chapter, we will discuss in more detail the personal choices you can  make to optimize your health by consuming the right amount of  high-quality protein.  Health Consequences of Protein Deficiency  Although severe protein deficiency is rare in the developed world, it  is a leading cause of death in children in many poor, underdeveloped  countries. There are two main syndromes associated with protein  deficiencies: Kwashiorkor and Marasmus. Kwashiorkor affects  millions of children worldwide.

The name Kwashiorkor comes  from a language in Ghana and means, “rejected one.” The syndrome  was named because it occurred most commonly in children who  had recently been weaned from the breast, usually because another  child had just been born. Subsequently the child was fed watery  porridge made from low-protein grains, which accounts for the low  protein intake. Kwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of  the feet and abdomen, poor skin health, growth retardation, low  muscle mass, and liver malfunction. Recall that one of protein’s  functional roles in the body is fluid balance. Diets extremely low  in protein do not provide enough amino acids for the synthesis  of albumin. One of the functions of albumin is to hold water in  the blood vessels, so having lower concentrations of blood albumin  results in water moving out of the blood vessels and into tissues,  causing swelling. The primary symptoms of Kwashiorkor include not  only swelling, but also diarrhea, fatigue, peeling skin, and irritability.  Severe protein deficiency in addition to other micronutrient  deficiencies, such as folate (vitamin B9), iodine, iron, and vitamin C  all contribute to the many health manifestations of this syndrome.

Many people follow high-protein diets because marketers tout  protein’s ability to stimulate weight loss. It is true that following  high-protein diets increases weight loss in some people. However  the number of individuals that remain on this type of diet is low  and many people who try the diet and stop regain the weight they  had lost. Additionally, there is a scientific hypothesis that there may  be health consequences of remaining on high-protein diets for the  long-term, but clinical trials are ongoing or scheduled to examine  this hypothesis further. As the high-protein diet trend arose so  did the intensely debated issue of whether there are any health  consequences of eating too much protein. Observational studies  conducted in the general population suggest diets high in animal  protein, specifically those in which the primary protein source is  red meat, are linked to a higher risk for kidney stones, kidney  disease, liver malfunction, colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis.  However, diets that include lots of red meat are also high in  saturated fat and cholesterol and sometimes linked to unhealthy  lifestyles, so it is difficult to conclude that the high protein content  is the culprit.  High protein diets appear to only increase the progression of  kidney disease and liver malfunction in people who already have  kidney or liver malfunction, and not to cause these problems.  However, the prevalence of kidney disorders is relatively high and  underdiagnosed. In regard to colon cancer, an assessment of more  than ten studies performed around the world published in the June  2011 issue of PLoS purports that a high intake of red meat and  processed meat is associated with a significant increase in colon  cancer risk.1Although there are a few ideas, the exact mechanism of  1.\\xa0Chan DS, Lau R, et al.

The  RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance.  Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino  acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are  catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver  breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly  converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then  transported to the kidneys for excretion. Most nitrogen is lost as  urea in the urine, but urea is also excreted in the feces. Proteins are  also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore,  is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to  balance the amount of protein used up and lost from the body. For  healthy adults, this amount of protein was determined to be 0.8  grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. You can calculate  410  |  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices'},\n",

The IOM used data from multiple studies that determined  nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the  RDA for protein. A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the  nitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A  person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted  nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is  breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of  imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such  as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein  diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in  less protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance  occurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken  in by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these  times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more  of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A  person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen  balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.  Dietary Sources of Protein  The protein food group consists of foods made from meat, seafood,  poultry, eggs, soy, dry beans, peas, and seeds. According to the  Harvard School of Public Health, “animal protein and vegetable  protein probably have the same effects on health. It’s the protein  package that’s likely to make a difference.”1  1.\\xa0Protein: The Bottom Line. Harvard School of Public  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices  |  411'},\n",

Seafood often contains healthy fats, and plant sources of  protein contain a high amount of fiber. Some animal-based protein- rich foods have an unhealthy amount of saturated fat and  cholesterol. When choosing your dietary sources of protein, take  note of the other nutrients and also the non-nutrients, such as  cholesterol, dyes, and preservatives, in order to make good  selections that will benefit your health. For instance, a hamburger  patty made from 80 percent lean meat contains 22 grams of protein,  5.7 grams of saturated fat, and 77 milligrams of cholesterol. A burger  made from 95 percent lean meat also contains 22 grams of protein,  but has 2.3 grams of saturated fat and 60 milligrams of cholesterol.  A cup of boiled soybeans contains 29 grams of protein, 2.2 grams of  saturated fat, and no cholesterol. For more comparisons of protein- rich foods, see Table 6.3 “Sources of Dietary Protein”.

Protein Quality  While protein is contained in a wide variety of foods, it differs in  quality. High-quality protein contains all the essential amino acids  in the proportions needed by the human body. The amino acid  profile of different foods is therefore one component of protein  quality. Foods that contain some of the essential amino acids are  called incomplete protein sources, while those that contain all nine  essential amino acids are called complete protein sources, or high- quality protein sources. Foods that are complete protein sources  include animal foods such as milk, cheese, eggs, fish, poultry, and  meat, and a few plant foods, such as soy and quinoa. The only  animal-based protein that is not complete is gelatin, which is made  of the protein, collagen.

For  example, grains are usually deficient in the amino acid lysine, and  legumes are deficient in methionine or tryptophan. Because grains  and legumes are not deficient in the same amino acids they can  complement each other in a diet. Incomplete protein foods are  called complementary foods because when consumed in tandem  they contain all nine essential amino acids at adequate levels.

Nutrition experts also recommend that athletes consume some  protein within one hour after exercise to enhance muscle tissue  repair during the recovery phase, but some carbohydrates and  water should be consumed as well.

We have noted that the protein requirements for most  people, even those that are active, is not high. Is taking protein  supplements ever justified, then? Neither protein nor amino acid  supplements have been scientifically proven to improve exercise  performance or increase strength. In addition, the average  American already consumes more protein than is required. Despite  these facts, many highly physically active individuals use protein or  amino acid supplements. According to the AND, American College  of Sports Medicine, and Dietitians of Canada, “the current evidence  indicates that protein and amino acid supplements are no more or  no less effective than food when energy is adequate for gaining lean  body mass.”5  Branched-chain amino acids, such as leucine, are often touted  as a way to build muscle tissue and enhance athletic performance.  Despite these marketing claims, a review in the June 2005 issue of  The Journal of Nutrition shows that most studies that evaluated a  variety of exercise types failed to show any performance-enhancing  effects of taking branched-chain amino acids.6  5.\\xa0American College of Sports Medicine, Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics, and Dietitians of Canada.

This means if you are interested  in enhancing exercise performance or building muscle, you do not  need to support the $20 billion supplement industry.  Although the evidence for protein and amino acid supplements  impacting athletic performance is lacking, there is some scientific  evidence that supports consuming high-quality dairy proteins, such  as casein and whey, and soy proteins positively influences muscle  recovery in response to hard training. If you choose to buy a bucket  of whey protein, use it to make a protein shake after an intense  workout and do not add more than what is required to obtain 20  to 25 grams of protein. As always, choosing high-quality protein  foods will help you build muscle and not empty your wallet as  much as buying supplements. Moreover, relying on supplements  for extra protein instead of food will not provide you with any of  the other essential nutrients. The bottom line is that whether you  are an endurance athlete or strength athlete, or just someone who  takes Zumba classes, there is very little need to put your money  into commercially sold protein and amino acid supplements. The  evidence to show that they are superior to regular food in  enhancing exercise performance is not sufficient.  What about the numerous protein shakes and protein bars on  the market?

Some protein bars have  a high amount of carbohydrates from added sugars and are not  actually the best source for protein, especially if you are not an  athlete. Protein bars are nutritionally designed to restore  carbohydrates and protein after endurance or strength training;  therefore they are not good meal replacements. If you want a low- cost alternative after an intense workout, make yourself a peanut  butter sandwich on whole-grain bread and add some sliced banana  for less than fifty cents.  Supermarket and health-food store shelves offer an extraordinary  number of high-protein shake mixes. While the carbohydrate count  is lower now in some of these products than a few years ago, they  still contain added fats and sugars. They also cost, on average, more  than two dollars per can. If you want more nutritional bang for your  buck, make your own shakes from whole foods. Use the AMDRs for  macronutrients as a guide to fill up the blender. Your homemade  shake can now replace some of the whole foods on your breakfast,  lunch, or dinner plate. Unless you are an endurance or strength  athlete and consume commercially sold protein bars and shakes  only postexercise, these products are not a good dietary source of  protein.

For thousands of years, alcohol has been consumed in a medicinal,  celebratory, and ritualistic manner. It is drunk in just about every  country and often in excessive amounts. Alcohol can be made from  a variety of different starch foods through the processes called  fermentation. Fermentation of a starchy food such as barley or  wheat can produce ethanol and CO2 which makes up what is  commonly known as beer. The Native Hawaiians distilled a mash of  fermented ti roots in iron try-pots pre-colonization in the 1700s.  This form of alcohol was called “Okolehao”. This alcoholic beverage  more commonly known today as “moonshine”, is still made locally in  the islands today.1  Alcohol is a psychoactive drug. A psychoactive drug is any  substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier primarily affecting  the functioning of the brain, be it altering mood, thinking, memory,  motor control, or behavior. Alcohols in chemistry refer to a group  of similar organic compounds, but in beverages the only alcohol  consumed is ethanol.

However, alcohol displays its two-faced  character again in its effects on body weight, making many scientific  studies contradictory. Multiple studies show high intakes of hard  liquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result  of the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks,  juices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even  more so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and  in some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory  results of scientific studies that have examined the association of  alcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that  alcohol contributes calories to the diet. When alcohol is drunk in  excess, it reduces the secretion of pancreatic juice and damages the  lining of the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrient digestion  and absorption. The impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients  in alcoholics contributes to their characteristic “skinniness” and  multiple associated micronutrient deficiencies. The most common  macronutrient deficiency among alcoholics is water, as it is  excreted  in  excess.  Commonly  associated  micronutrient  deficiencies include thiamine, pyridoxine, folate, vitamin A,  magnesium, calcium, and zinc. Furthermore, alcoholics typically  replace calories from alcohol with those of nutritious foods,  sometimes getting 50 percent or more of their daily caloric intake  from alcoholic beverages.  442  |  Health Consequences of Alcohol Abuse'},\n",

As more alcohol is ingested, this  stimulates the production of acetaldehyde by both the alcohol  dehydrogenase and MEOS systems. As the levels of acetaldehyde  increase inside the liver cells with heavy consumption of alcohol,  some of the acetaldehyde diffuse into the blood circulation. In  circulation, high levels of acetaldehyde cause nausea and vomiting.  Vomiting causes more body dehydration and loss of electrolytes.  If the dehydration becomes severe enough, this can impair brain  function and a person may lose consciousness.  Alcohol can adversely affect nearly every area of the brain. When  BAC rises, the central nervous system is depressed. Alcohol disrupts  the way nerve cells communicate with each other by interfering  with receptors on certain cells. The immediate impact of alcohol  on the brain can be seen in the awkwardly displayed symptoms  of confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and other signs of  intoxication. These symptoms will go away once drinking stops,  but abusive alcohol consumption over time can lead to long-lasting  damage to the brain and nervous system. This is because alcohol  and its metabolic byproducts kill brain cells.  Effects of Excessive Alcohol on the Liver  Alcohol stimulates the release of epinephrine from the kidneys.  Epinephrine binds to receptors in the liver cells to stimulate the  release of glucagon from the pancreas. Glucagon and epinephrine  stimulate glycogenolysis in the liver cells. Epinephrine also  stimulates the breakdown of triglycerides and glycerol into free  fatty acids \\xa0in adipose tissue and are released into the bloodstream  and travel to the liver.

The term Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) is used to describe liver  problems linked to excessive alcohol intake. ALD can be progressive,  with individuals first suffering from a fatty liver and going on to  develop cirrhosis. It is also possible to have different forms of ALD  at the same time.

In the liver’s attempt  to replace the dead cells, surviving liver cells multiply. The result is  clusters of newly formed liver cells, also called regenerative nodules,  within the scar tissue. This state is called cirrhosis of the liver.  The three most common forms of ALD are:  • Fatty liver. A rather benign disorder that develops after  excessive alcohol consumption; however it can progress to  more fatal diseases. Fatty liver is reversible if alcohol use is  brought under control.  • Alcoholic hepatitis. The symptoms of this alcohol-induced liver  inflammation are a swollen liver, abdominal pain, nausea, fever,  jaundice, and vomiting. Although linked to alcohol use, even  people who drink moderately can sometimes develop this  condition, and not all alcohol abusers do. If a person stops  drinking alcohol, the liver damage can be reversed. But if they  continue, cirrhosis may develop and death can result.  • Cirrhosis. This serious and sometimes fatal form of ALD  develops when liver cells die and form scar tissue, which  blocks blood flow and causes wastes and toxins to build up in  the system. Strictly speaking, cirrhosis cannot be cured. It can,  however, be stopped with medical treatment and  complications can be managed if the individual stops drinking,  and many do survive. Not all cases of cirrhosis are strictly due  to alcoholism, and not all alcoholics develop the disease.  Symptoms of cirrhosis include the buildup of abdominal fluid  (ascites), abdominal pain, fever, thirst, confusion, and fatigue.

In their journey through circulation, VLDL particles  are eventually degraded to low density lipoproteins (LDL) particles.  LDL particles are also known as “bad cholesterol”. Higher levels  of LDL particles in circulation lead to the build-up of cholesterol  deposition plaques inside the walls of the blood vessels (known as  atherosclerosis). These plaques can impair or stop blood flow to the  cells. If an artery is blocked, the cells cannot make enough energy  and eventually stop working. If the artery remains blocked for more  than a few minutes, the cells may die. When a cardiac artery is  blocked, this causes a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction).  Depending on the length and severity of the blockage, damage to  the cardiac cells may be permanent and irreversible.

A  review of twenty-nine studies concluded that moderate alcohol  intake reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by about 30  percent in comparison to those who do not consume alcohol.1  Several other studies demonstrate that moderate alcohol  consumption reduces the incidences of stroke and heart attack, and  also death caused by cardiovascular and heart disease.

Moreover,  there is some scientific evidence that moderate alcohol intake  reduces the risk for metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and  gallstones.

Normal function of the human body  requires a constant input and output of energy to maintain life.  Various chemical components of food provide the input of energy to  the body. The chemical breakdown of those chemicals provides the  energy needed to carry out thousands of body functions that allow  the body to perform daily functions and tasks such as breathing,  walking up a flight of steps, and studying for a test.  Energy is classified as either potential or kinetic. Potential energy  is stored energy, or energy waiting to happen. Kinetic energy is  energy in motion. To illustrate this, think of an Olympic swimmer  standing at the pool’s edge awaiting the sound of the whistle to  begin the race. While he waits for the signal, he has potential  energy. When the whistle sounds and he dives into the pool and  begins to swim, his energy is kinetic (in motion).  In food and in components of the human body, potential energy  resides in the chemical bonds of specific molecules such as  carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol. This potential energy is  converted into kinetic energy in the body that drives many body  functions ranging from muscle and nerve function to driving the  synthesis of body protein for growth. After potential energy is  released to provide kinetic energy, it ultimately becomes thermal  energy or heat. You can notice this when you exercise and your  body heats up.  The Calorie Is a Unit of Energy  The amount of energy in nutrients or the amount of energy  expended by the body can be quantified with a variety of units  used to measure energy. In the US, the kilocalorie (kcal) is most  commonly used and is often just referred to as a calorie. Strictly  speaking, a kcal is 1000 calories.

Most other countries use the kilojoule (kJ) as their standard unit  of energy. The Joule is a measure of energy based on work  accomplished – the energy needed to produce a specific amount of  force. Since calories and Joules are both measures of energy, one  can be converted to the other – 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ.  Estimating Caloric Content  The energy contained in energy-yielding nutrients differs because  the energy-yielding nutrients are composed of different types of  chemical bonds. The carbohydrate or protein in a food yields  approximately 4 kilocalories per gram, whereas the triglycerides  that compose the fat in a food yield 9 kilocalories per gram. A  kilocalorie of energy performs one thousand times more work than  a calorie. On the Nutrition Facts panel found on packaged food, the  calories listed for a particular food are actually kilocalories.  Estimating the number of calories in commercially prepared food  is fairly easy since the total number of calories in a serving of a  particular food is listed on the Nutrition Facts panel. If you wanted  to know the number of calories in the breakfast you consumed  this morning just add up the number of calories in each food. For  example, if you ate one serving of yogurt that contained 150 calories,  on which you sprinkled half of a cup of low-fat granola cereal that  contained 209 calories, and drank a glass of orange juice that  contained 100 calories, the total number of calories you consumed  at breakfast is 150 + 209 + 100 = 459 calories.

An Organism Requires Energy and Nutrient  Input  Energy is required in order to build molecules into larger  macromolecules (like proteins), and to turn macromolecules into  organelles and cells, which then turn into tissues, organs, and organ  systems, and finally into an organism. Proper nutrition provides  the necessary nutrients to make the energy that supports life’s  processes. Your body builds new macromolecules from the  nutrients in food.  Nutrient and Energy Flow  Energy is stored in a nutrient’s chemical bonds. Energy comes from  sunlight, which plants capture and, via photosynthesis, use it to  transform carbon dioxide in the air into the molecule glucose. When  the glucose bonds are broken, energy is released. Bacteria, plants,  and animals (including humans) harvest the energy in glucose via a  biological process called cellular respiration. In this process oxygen  is required and the chemical energy of glucose is gradually released  in a series of chemical reactions. Some of this energy is trapped  in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and some is lost as  heat. ATP can be used when needed to drive chemical reactions in  cells that require an input of energy. Cellular respiration requires  oxygen (aerobic) and it is provided as a byproduct of photosynthesis.  The byproducts of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide (CO2) and  water, which plants use to conduct photosynthesis again. Thus,  carbon is constantly cycling between plants and animals.

High-quality  foods are nutrient dense, meaning they contain lots of nutrients  relative to the amount of calories they provide. Nutrient-dense  foods are the opposite of “empty-calorie” foods such as carbonated  sugary soft drinks, which provide many calories and very little, if  any, other nutrients. Food quality is additionally associated with  its taste, texture, appearance, microbial content, and how much  consumers like it.  458  |  Introduction'},\n",

The structural  elements of an atom are protons (positively charged), neutrons (no  charge), and electrons (negatively charged). Protons and neutrons  are contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has  a positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted  to this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud.  Electrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the  charge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with  one another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending  on the number of electrons within an atom. Atoms are more stable  when their electrons orbit in pairs. An atom with an odd number  of electrons must have an unpaired electron. In most cases, these  unpaired electrons are used to create chemical bonds. A chemical  bond is the attractive force between atoms and contains potential  energy. By bonding, electrons find pairs and chemicals become part  of a molecule.  Bond formation and bond breaking are chemical reactions that  involve the movement of electrons between atoms. These chemical  reactions occur continuously in the body. We previously reviewed  how glucose breaks down into water and carbon dioxide as part of  cellular respiration. The energy released by breaking those bonds  is used to form molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Recall  how during this process electrons are extracted from glucose in a  stepwise manner and transferred to other molecules. Occasionally  electrons “escape” and, instead of completing the cellular  respiration cycle, are transferred to an oxygen molecule.

Metabolism is either categorized as catabolism, referring to all  metabolic processes involved in molecule breakdown, or anabolism,  which includes all metabolic processes involved in building bigger  molecules. Generally, catabolic processes release energy and  anabolic processes consume energy. The overall goals of  metabolism are energy transfer and matter transport. Energy is  transformed from food macronutrients into cellular energy, which  is used to perform cellular work. Metabolism transforms the matter  of macronutrients into substances a cell can use to grow and  reproduce and also into waste products. For example, enzymes are  proteins and their job is to catalyze chemical reactions. Catalyze  means to speed-up a chemical reaction and reduce the energy  required to complete the chemical reaction, without the catalyst  being used up in the reaction. Without enzymes, chemical reactions  would not happen at a fast enough rate and would use up too  much energy for life to exist. A metabolic pathway is a series of  enzyme catalyzed reactions that transform the starting material  (known as a substrate) into intermediates, that are the substrates  for subsequent enzymatic reactions in the pathway, until, finally,  an end product is synthesized by the last enzymatic reaction in  the pathway. Some metabolic pathways are complex and involve  many enzymatic reactions, and others involve only a few chemical  reactions.  To ensure cellular efficiency, the metabolic pathways involved in  catabolism and anabolism are regulated in concert by energy status,  hormones, and substrate and end-product levels. The concerted  regulation of metabolic pathways prevents cells from inefficiently  building a molecule when it is already available.

The entire process of digestion converts the large  polymers in food to monomers that can be absorbed. Starches are  broken down to monosaccharides, lipids are broken down to fatty  acids, and proteins are broken down to amino acids. These  monomers are absorbed into the bloodstream either directly, as is  the case with monosaccharides and amino acids, or repackaged in  intestinal cells for transport by an indirect route through lymphatic  vessels, as is the case with most fatty acids and other fat-soluble  molecules.

In this catabolic pathway,  four enzymatic steps sequentially remove two-carbon molecules  from long chains of fatty acids, yielding acetyl-CoA molecules.

For example, the citric-acid-cycle intermediate,  α-ketoglutarate can be anabolically processed to the amino acids  glutamate or glutamine if they are required. The human body is  capable of synthesizing eleven of the twenty amino acids that make  up proteins. The metabolic pathways of amino acid synthesis are  all inhibited by the specific amino acid that is the end-product of a  given pathway. Thus, if a cell has enough glutamine it turns off its  synthesis.  Anabolic pathways are regulated by their end-products, but even  more so by the energy state of the cell. When there is ample energy,  bigger molecules, such as protein, RNA and DNA, will be built as  needed. Alternatively, when energy is insufficient, proteins and  other molecules will be destroyed and catabolized to release energy.

The  Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your  Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). It takes into account your  age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is  a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy  needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is  calculated for those over 18 years of age via the following formulas:  Adult male: EER = 662 − [9.53 X age (y)] + PA X [15.91 X wt (kg) +  5.39.6 X ht (m)]  Adult female: EER = 354 − [6.91 x age (y)] + PA x [9.36 x wt (kg) +  726 x ht (m)]  Note: to convert pounds to kilograms, divide weight in pounds by  2.2. To convert feet to meters, divide height in feet by 3.3.

Total Energy Expenditure (Output)  The amount of energy you expend every day includes not only the  calories you burn during physical activity, but also the calories you  burn while at rest (basal metabolism), and the calories you burn  when you digest food. The sum of caloric expenditure is referred  to as total energy expenditure (TEE). Basal metabolism refers to  those metabolic pathways necessary to support and maintain the  body’s basic functions (e.g. breathing, heartbeat, liver and kidney  function) while at rest. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount  of energy required by the body to conduct its basic functions over  a certain time period. The great majority of energy expended  (between 50 and 70 percent) daily is from conducting life’s basic  processes.

BMR is dependent on body size,  body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, and genetics. People  with a larger frame size have a higher BMR simply because they  have more mass. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue  even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the  higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and  a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than  men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR.  Nutritional status also affects basal metabolism. Caloric restriction,  as occurs while dieting, for example, causes a decline in BMR. This is  because the body attempts to maintain homeostasis and will adapt  by slowing down its basic functions to offset the decrease in energy  intake. Body temperature and thyroid hormone levels are additional  determinants of BMR.

Hunger pangs are real and so is a “growling” stomach. When the  stomach is empty it contracts, producing the characteristic pang  and “growl.” The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural  signals to the hypothalamus, which relays other neural signals to  parts of the brain. This results in the conscious feeling of the need  to eat. Alternatively, after you eat a meal the stomach stretches and  sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety  and relaying the message to stop eating. The stomach also sends out  certain hormones when it is full and others when it is empty. These  hormones communicate to the hypothalamus and other areas of the  brain either to stop eating or to find some food.  Fat tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake.

The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked a craze in the  research world and the diet pill industry, as it was hypothesized that  if you give leptin to a person who is overweight, they will decrease  their food intake. Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials  it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually  resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as  well to it.1  Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese  person there is no sustained effect on food intake.  Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake.  The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they  are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high  the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty  and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis. Both  undernutrition and overnutrition affect hormone levels and the  neural circuitry controlling appetite, which makes losing or gaining  weight a substantial physiological hurdle.

Psychological/Behavioral Influences  When your mouth waters in response to the smell of a roasting  Thanksgiving turkey and steaming hot pies, you are experiencing  a psychological influence on food intake. A person’s perception of  good-smelling and good-tasting food influences what they eat and  how much they eat. Mood and emotions are associated with food  intake. Depression, low self-esteem, compulsive disorders, and  emotional trauma are sometimes linked with increased food intake  and obesity.  Certain behaviors can be predictive of how much a person eats.  Some of these are how much food a person heaps onto their plate,  how often they snack on calorie-dense, salty foods, how often they  watch television or sit at a computer, and how often they eat out.

You can begin this task by starting simple, such as  requesting extra tomatoes and lettuce on your burger and more  nutrient-dense choices in the salad bar. Also, choose their low- calorie menu options and help support the emerging market of  healthier choices in the fast food industry. In today’s fast-paced  society, it is difficult for most people to avoid fast food all the time.  When you do need a quick bite on the run, choose the fast food  restaurants that serve healthier foods.

A major problem with these theories is that they  overgeneralize and do not take into account that not all individuals  respond in the same way to changes in food intake or energy  expenditure. This brings up the importance of the interactions of  genes and the environment.  Not all individuals who take a weight-loss drug lose weight and  not all people who smoke are thin. An explanation for these  discrepancies is that each individual’s genes respond differently  to a specific environment. Alternatively, environmental factors can  influence a person’s gene profile, which is exemplified by the effects  of the prenatal environment on body weight and fatness and disease  incidence later in life.1  One example is a study of the offspring of women who were  overweight during pregnancy had a greater propensity for being  overweight  and  for  developing  Type  2  diabetes.  Thus,  undernutrition and overnutrition during pregnancy influence body  weight and disease risk for offspring later in life. They do so by  adapting energy metabolism to the early nutrient and hormonal  environment in the womb.  1.\\xa0Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al. (2008).

Of course, the sedentary  lifestyle of many North Americans contributes to their average  energy expenditure in daily life. Simply put, the more you sit, the  less energy you expend.

A study published in the June 2001  issue of the International Journal of Behavioral Nutritionand  Physical Activity reports that even breaking up sitting-time with  frequent but brief increased energy expenditure activities, such as  walking for five minutes every hour, helps maintain weight and even  aids in weight loss.3  Americans partake in an excessive amount of screen time, which  is a sedentary behavior that not only reduces energy expenditure,  but also contributes to weight gain because of the exposure to  aggressive advertising campaigns for unhealthy foods.  2.\\xa0Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al.

Escalators, moving walkways, and elevators  (not to mention cars!) are common modes of transportation that  reduce average daily energy expenditure. Office work, high-stress  jobs, and occupations requiring extended working hours are all  societal pressures that reduce the time allotted for exercise of large  populations of Americans. Even the remote controls that many have  for various electronic devices in their homes contribute to the US  society being less active. More obesogenic factors were discussed in  the weight management section of this chapter.  Socioeconomic status has been found to be inversely proportional  to weight gain. One reason for this relationship is that inhabitants  of low-income neighborhoods have reduced access to safe streets  and parks for walking. Another is that fitness clubs are expensive  and few are found in lower-income neighborhoods. The recent and  long-lasting economic crisis in this country is predicted to have  profound effects on the average body weight of Americans. The  number of homeless in this country is rising with many children and  adults living in hotels and cars. As you can imagine neither of these  “home spaces” has a kitchen, making it impossible to cook nutritious  meals and resulting in increased economically-forced access to  cheap, unhealthy foods, such as that at a nearby gas station.

China, the most populous country in the world, now has more than  215 million people, approximately one-fifth of their population, that  are considered overweight or obese.4  The increase in China’s waistline is partly attributed to changes  in the traditional diet, more sedentary lives, and a massive increase  in motor vehicle use. Moreover, China’s recent famines in the 1950s,  which affected the poor and lower classes to a greater extent than  the upper class, have sanctioned lax social attitudes toward body  fat and reinspired the age-old Chinese belief that excess body fat  represents health and prosperity.  One of the worst statistics regarding overweight and obesity in  China is that more than ten million adolescents between ages  seventeen and eighteen were overweight in 2000, which is twenty- eight times the number that were overweight in 1985.5  The associated diseases of overweight and obesity happen over  many years, and signs and symptoms commonly take decades to  manifest.

In 2003 the idea  was first published that promoting small lifestyle changes to reduce  weight gain occurring over time in all age groups may better reduce  obesity rates in the American population.10  Scientific studies have demonstrated that asking people to  increase the number of steps they take each day while providing  them with pedometers that count the steps they take each day  successfully prevented weight gain. A “small-changes” study  published in the October 2007 issue of Pediatrics evaluated whether  families that made two small lifestyle changes, which were to walk  an additional two thousand steps per day and to eliminate 100  kilocalories per day from their typical diet by replacing dietary sugar  with a noncaloric sweetener, would prevent weight gain in  10.\\xa0Hill JO.

Vitamins  are absorbed primarily in the small intestine and their bioavailability  is dependent on the food composition of the diet. Fat-soluble  vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fat. Therefore, if a meal  is very low in fat, the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins will be  impaired. Once fat-soluble vitamins have been absorbed in the small  intestine, they are packaged and incorporated into chylomicrons  along with other fatty acids and transported in the lymphatic  system to the liver.

Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived  foods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms  of vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes  referred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant- derived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in  the body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin  A. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them  their yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids  have been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found  in the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the  xanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do  not.  In plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and  act as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta- cryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body.  The other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological  actions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity,  but they likely act by other mechanisms, too.  Vitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in  small intestine, and transported to the liver. The liver stores and  exports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a  retinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells. Carotenoids are  not absorbed as well as vitamin A, but similar to vitamin A, they do  require fat in the meal for absorption. In intestinal cells, carotenoids  Fat-Soluble Vitamins  |  521'},\n",

In the liver,  carotenoids are repackaged into lipoproteins, which transport them  to cells.  The retinoids are aptly named as their most notable function is  in the retina of the eye where they aid in vision, particularly in  seeing under low-light conditions. This is why night blindness is the  most definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency.Vitamin A has several  important functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a  healthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body  are similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can  interact with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A  assists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of  tissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant,  vitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining  glutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of  enzymes that detoxify free radicals.  Vision  Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the  eye retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used to help  the pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see  under low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in  less rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a  condition referred to as night-blindness.  Insufficient intake of dietary vitamin A over time can also cause  complete vision loss. In fact, vitamin A deficiency is the number  one cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Vitamin A not only  supports the vision function of eyes but also maintains the  coverings and linings of the eyes. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to  the dysfunction of the linings and coverings of the eye (eg. bitot  spots),  causing  dryness  of  the  eyes,  a  condition  called  522  |  Fat-Soluble Vitamins'},\n",

In Asia in the late 1980s,  targeted populations of children were administered vitamin A  supplements, and the death rates from measles and diarrhea  declined by up to 50 percent. Vitamin A supplementation in these  deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who  contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the  diseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results  of these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the  World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations  Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns  against vitamin A deficiency. UNICEF estimates that the distribution  of over half a billion vitamin A capsules prevents 350,000 childhood  deaths annually.1  In the twenty-first century, science has demonstrated that  vitamin A greatly affects the immune system. What we are still  lacking are clinical trials investigating the proper doses of vitamin  A required to help ward off infectious disease and how large of  an effect vitamin A supplementation has on populations that are  not deficient in this vitamin. This brings up one of our common  themes in this text—micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to  the development, progression, and severity of a disease, but this  does not mean that an increased intake of these micronutrients will  solely prevent or cure disease. The effect, as usual, is cumulative and  depends on the diet as a whole, among other things.  1.\\xa0Sommer A. (2008). Vitamin A Deficiency and Clinical  Disease: An Historical Overview.

However, vitamin  A supplements have actually been found to increase the risk of lung  cancer in people who are at high risk for the disease (i.e., smokers,  ex-smokers, workers exposed to asbestos).

Vitamin D Functions and Health Benefits  Vitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins derived from  cholesterol. Vitamins D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (calcitriol) are the  only ones known to have biological actions in the human body.  The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. In fact,  for most people, more than 90 percent of their vitamin D3 comes  from the casual exposure to the UVB rays in sunlight. Anything  that reduces your exposure to the sun’s UVB rays decreases the  amount of vitamin D3 your skin synthesizes. That would include  long winters, your home’s altitude, whether you are wearing  sunscreen, and the color of your skin (including tanned skin). Do you  ever wonder about an increased risk for skin cancer by spending too  much time in the sun? Do not fret. Less than thirty minutes of sun  exposure to the arms and legs will increase blood levels of vitamin  D3 more than orally taking 10,000 IU (250 micrograms) of vitamin  D3.

In the absence of an adequate  intake of vitamin D, less than 15 percent of calcium is absorbed  from foods or supplements. The effects of calcitriol on calcium  homeostasis are critical for bone health. A deficiency of vitamin  D in children causes the bone disease nutritional rickets. Rickets  is very common among children in developing countries and is  characterized by soft, weak, deformed bones that are exceptionally  susceptible to fracture. In adults, vitamin D deficiency causes a  similar disease called osteomalacia, which is characterized by low  BMD. Osteomalacia has the same symptoms and consequences as  osteoporosis and often coexists with osteoporosis.

Alpha-tocopherol and vitamin E’s other  constituents  are  fat-soluble  and  primarily  responsible  for  protecting cell membranes against lipid destruction caused by free  radicals, therefore making it an antioxidant. When alpha-tocopherol  interacts with a free radical it is no longer capable of acting as an  antioxidant unless it is enzymatically regenerated. Vitamin C helps  to regenerate some of the alpha-tocopherol, but the remainder is  eliminated from the body.

Vitamin K is critical for blood function acting  as coenzymes which play an essential role in blood coagulation (aka  blood clotting). Blood-clotting proteins are continuously circulating  in the blood. Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets stick to the  wound forming a plug. Without vitamin K, blood would not clot.  A deficiency in vitamin K causes bleeding disorders. It is relatively  rare, but people who have liver or pancreatic disease, celiac disease,  or malabsorption conditions are at higher risk for vitamin K  deficiency.

It acts as  a cofactor for enzymes that break down glucose for energy  production (Figure 9.7 “Enzyme Active Site for Cofactors” ). Thiamin  plays a key role in nerve cells as the glucose that is catabolized by  thiamin is needed for an energy source. Additionally, thiamin plays a  role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and is therefore required  for RNA, DNA, and ATP synthesis.  The brain and heart are most affected by a deficiency in thiamin.  Thiamin deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause symptoms  of fatigue, confusion, movement impairment, pain in the lower  extremities, swelling, and heart failure. It is prevalent in societies  whose main dietary staple is white rice. During the processing of  white rice, the bran is removed, along with what were called in  the early nineteenth century, “accessory factors,” that are vital for  metabolism. Dutch physician Dr. Christiaan Eijkman cured chickens  of beriberi by feeding them unpolished rice bran in 1897. By 1912, Sir  Frederick Gowland Hopkins determined from his experiments with  animals that the “accessory factors,” eventually renamed vitamins,  are needed in the diet to support growth, since animals fed a diet  of pure carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and minerals failed to  grow.4Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in  Physiology (or Medicine) in 1929 for their discoveries in the  emerging science of nutrition.

Niacin (B3)  Niacin is a component of the coenzymes NADH and NADPH, which  are involved in the catabolism and/or anabolism of carbohydrates,  lipids, and proteins. NADH is the predominant electron carrier and  transfers electrons to the electron-transport chain to make ATP.  NADPH is also required for the anabolic pathways of fatty-acid  and cholesterol synthesis. In contrast to other vitamins, niacin can  be synthesized by humans from the amino acid tryptophan in an  anabolic process requiring enzymes dependent on riboflavin,  vitamin B6, and iron. Niacin is made from tryptophan only after  tryptophan has met all of its other needs in the body. The  contribution of tryptophan-derived niacin to niacin needs in the  body varies widely and a few scientific studies have demonstrated  that diets high in tryptophan have very little effect on niacin  deficiency. Niacin deficiency is commonly known as pellagra and  the symptoms include fatigue, decreased appetite, and indigestion.  \\xa0These symptoms are then commonly followed by the four D’s:  diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and sometimes death.

Folate  Folate is a required coenzyme for the synthesis of the amino acid  methionine, and for making RNA and DNA. Therefore, rapidly  dividing cells are most affected by folate deficiency. Red blood cells,  white blood cells, and platelets are continuously being synthesized  in the bone marrow from dividing stem cells. When folate is  deficient, cells cannot divide normally A consequence of folate  deficiency is macrocytic or megaloblastic anemia. Macrocytic and  megaloblastic mean “big cell,” and anemia refers to fewer red blood  cells or red blood cells containing less hemoglobin. Macrocytic  anemia is characterized by larger and fewer red blood cells. It is  caused by red blood cells being unable to produce DNA and RNA  fast enough—cells grow but do not divide, making them large in size.

Although some marketers claim taking a vitamin that contains one- thousand times the daily value of certain B vitamins boosts energy  and performance, this is a myth that is not backed by science.

Buyers of B-vitamin supplements beware; B vitamins are not  stored in the body and all excess will be flushed down the toilet  along with the extra money spent.  B vitamins are naturally present in numerous foods, and many  other foods are enriched with them. In the United States, B-vitamin  deficiencies are rare; however in the nineteenth century some  vitamin-B deficiencies plagued many people in North America.  Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, was prominent in poorer  Americans whose main dietary staple was refined cornmeal. Its  symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia,  and even death. Some of the health consequences of pellagra are  the result of niacin being in insufficient supply to support the body’s  metabolic functions.

Based on the antioxidant-supplement  industry’s success, the general public appears to believe these  health claims. However, these claims are not backed by scientific  evidence; rather, there is some evidence suggesting supplements  can actually cause harm. While scientists have found evidence  supporting the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods as a method  of reducing the risk of chronic disease, there is no “miracle cure”;  no pill or supplement alone can provide the same benefits as a  healthy diet. Remember, it is the combination of antioxidants and  other nutrients in healthy foods that is beneficial. In this section, we  will review how particular antioxidants function in the body, learn  how they work together to protect the body against free radicals,  and explore the best nutrient-rich dietary sources of antioxidants.  One dietary source of antioxidants is vitamins. In our discussion of  antioxidant vitamins, we will focus on vitamins E, C, and A.  Figure 9.21 Antioxidants’ Role  Antioxidants  |  593'},\n",

For  example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of  free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader  (such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as  hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is  thus neutralized. Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide  acts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites,  meaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut.  Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as  well. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide,  which is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive  oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free  radicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with  proteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical  nitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a  chemical messenger in the brain. By acting as signaling molecules,  free radicals are involved in the control of their own synthesis,  stress responses, regulation of cell growth and death, and  metabolism.

They do so by being free radicals  themselves or by adding energy that provokes electrons to move  between atoms. Excessive exposure to environmental sources of  free radicals can contribute to disease by overwhelming the free  radical detoxifying systems and those processes involved in  repairing oxidative damage.  Oxidative Stress  Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ  between the amount of free radicals and the capabilities of the  detoxifying and repair systems. Sustained oxidative damage results  only under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and  repair systems are insufficient. Free radical-induced damage, when  left unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can  contribute to disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a  contributing factor to cancer, atherosclerosis (hardening of  arteries), arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease,  Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, emphysema,  and cataracts.  Aging is a process that is genetically determined but modulated  by factors in the environment. In the process of aging, tissue  function declines. The idea that oxidative stress is the primary  contributor to age-related tissue decline has been around for  decades, and it is true that tissues accumulate free radical-induced  damage as we age. Recent scientific evidence slightly modifies this  theory by suggesting oxidative stress is not the initial trigger for  age-related decline of tissues; it is suggested that the true culprit  is progressive dysfunction of metabolic processes, which leads to  increases in free radical production, thus influencing the stress  response of tissues as they age.  598  |  The Body’s Offense'},\n",

Carotenoids are one type of phytochemical.  Phytochemicals also include indoles, lignans, phytoestrogens,  stanols,  saponins,  terpenes,  flavonoids,  carotenoids,  anthocyanidins, phenolic acids, and many more. They are found not  only in fruits and vegetables, but also in grains, seeds, nuts, and  legumes.  Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants, but they have several  other functions, such as mimicking hormones, altering absorption  of cholesterol, inhibiting inflammatory responses, and blocking the  actions of certain enzymes.  Phytochemicals are present in small amounts in the food supply,  and although thousands have been and are currently being  scientifically studied, their health benefits remain largely unknown.  Also largely unknown is their potential for toxicity, which could be  substantial if taken in large amounts in the form of supplements.  Moreover, phytochemicals often act in conjunction with each other  and with micronutrients. Thus, supplementing with only a few may  impair the functions of other phytochemicals or micronutrients.  As with the antioxidant vitamins, it is the mixture and variety of  phytochemicals in foods that are linked to health benefits.  \\xa0 Table 9.33 Some Phytochemical’s Obtained from Diet and Their  Related Functions  600  |  Phytochemicals'},\n",

Minerals  are abundant in our everyday lives. From the soil in your front yard  to the jewelry you wear on your body, we interact with minerals  constantly. There are 20 essential minerals that must be consumed  in our diets to remain healthy. \\xa0The amount of each mineral found in  our bodies vary greatly and therefore, so does consumption of those  minerals. When there is a deficiency in an essential mineral, health  problems may arise.  Major minerals are classified as minerals that are required in the  diet each day in amounts larger than 100 milligrams. These include  sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and  sulfur. These major minerals can be found in various foods. For  example, in Guam, the major mineral, calcium, is consumed in the  diet not only through dairy, a common source of calcium, but also  through through the mixed dishes, desserts and vegetables that  they consume. Consuming a varied diet significantly improves an  individual’s ability to meet their nutrient needs. \\xa01  Figure 10.1 The Major Minerals  1.\\xa0Pobocik RS, Trager A, Monson LM. (2008).

Although only 1 percent of  the calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues,  it is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium  levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body  will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby  releasing stored calcium into the blood. \\xa0Thus, bone tissue sacrifices  its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone  health is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why  blood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake.  Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the  body like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium  function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that  when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling  process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the  osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium  phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium  salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue. When your  diet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases  causing it to become brittle and weak. Thus, increased calcium  intake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue.  Greater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD,  and to greater bone strength. The remaining calcium plays a role  in nerve impulse transmission by facilitating electrical impulse  transmission from one nerve cell to another. Calcium in muscle cells  Calcium  |  613'},\n",

Calcium is also essential in blood clotting by activating clotting  factors to fix damaged tissue.  In addition to calcium’s four primary functions calcium has  several other minor functions that are also critical for maintaining  normal physiology. For example, without calcium, the hormone  insulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and  glycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to  provide energy for muscle contraction.  Maintaining Calcium Levels  Because calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood  calcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid  hormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels  are low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three  different mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium  stored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase  calcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third,  PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to  calcitriol. \\xa0Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal  cells and increases dietary calcium absorption. When blood calcium  levels become too high, the hormone calcitonin is secreted by  certain cells in the thyroid gland and PTH secretion stops.\\xa0 At higher  nonphysiological concentrations, calcitonin lowers blood calcium  levels by increasing calcium excretion in the urine, preventing  further absorption of calcium in the gut and by directly inhibiting  bone resorption.

It is reported that chelated forms of  calcium supplements are easier to absorb as the chelation process  protects the calcium from oxalates and phytates that may bind with  the calcium in the intestines. However, these are more expensive  supplements and only increase calcium absorption up to 10 percent.  In people with low dietary intakes of calcium, calcium supplements  have a negligible benefit on bone health in the absence of a vitamin  D supplement. However, when calcium supplements are taken along  with vitamin D, there are many benefits to bone health: peak bone  mass is increased in early adulthood, BMD is maintained throughout  adulthood, the risk of developing osteoporosis is reduced, and the  incidence of fractures is decreased in those who already had  osteoporosis. Calcium and vitamin D pills do not have to be taken at  the same time for effectiveness. But remember that vitamin D has to  be activated and in the bloodstream to promote calcium absorption.

Since the GI tract can only handle about 500  milligrams of calcium at one time, it is recommended to have  split doses of calcium supplements rather than taking a few all  10.\\xa0Bolland MJ. et al.

Dietary Reference Intake for Calcium  The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for calcium are listed  in Table 10.1 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium”. The RDA is  elevated to 1,300 milligrams per day during adolescence because  this is the life stage with accelerated bone growth. Studies have  shown that a higher intake of calcium during puberty increases  the total amount of bone tissue that accumulates in a person. For  women above age fifty and men older than seventy-one, the RDAs  are also a bit higher for several reasons including that as we age,  calcium absorption in the gut decreases, vitamin D3 activation is  reduced, and maintaining adequate blood levels of calcium is  important to prevent an acceleration of bone tissue loss (especially  during menopause). Currently, the dietary intake of calcium for  females above age nine is, on average, below the RDA for calcium.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that people do not  consume over 2,500 milligrams per day of calcium as it may cause  adverse effects in some people.

Dietary Sources of Calcium  In the typical American diet, calcium is obtained mostly from dairy  products, primarily cheese. A slice of cheddar or Swiss cheese  contains just over 200 milligrams of calcium. One cup of nonfat milk  contains approximately 300 milligrams of calcium, which is about  a third of the RDA for calcium for most adults. Foods fortified with  calcium such as cereals, soy milk, and orange juice also provide one  third or greater of the calcium RDA. Although the typical American  diet relies mostly on dairy products for obtaining calcium, there are  other good non-dairy sources of calcium.  \\xa0 Calcium  |  625'},\n",

Tofu (made with calcium sulfate), turnip greens,  mustard greens, and chinese cabbage are good sources. For  a list of non-dairy sources you can find the calcium content  for thousands of foods by visiting the USDA National  Nutrient Database (http:/ /www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/ foodcomp/search/). When obtaining your calcium from a  vegan diet, it is important to know that some plant-based  foods significantly impair the absorption of calcium. These  include spinach, Swiss chard, rhubarb, beets, cashews, and  peanuts. With careful planning and good selections, you  can ensure that you are getting enough calcium in your diet  even if you do not drink milk or consume other dairy  products.  Calcium Bioavailability  In the small intestine, calcium absorption primarily takes place in  the duodenum (first section of the small intestine) when intakes  are low, but calcium is also absorbed passively in the jejunum and  ileum (second and third sections of the small intestine), especially  when intakes are higher. The body doesn’t completely absorb all the  calcium in food.

The greatest positive influence on calcium absorption comes  from having an adequate intake of vitamin D. People deficient in  vitamin D absorb less than 15 percent of calcium from the foods they  eat. The hormone estrogen is another factor that enhances calcium  bioavailability. Thus, as a woman ages and goes through menopause,  during which estrogen levels fall, the amount of calcium absorbed  decreases and the risk for bone disease increases. Some fibers, such  as inulin, found in jicama, onions, and garlic, also promote calcium  intestinal uptake.  Chemicals that bind to calcium decrease its bioavailability. These  negative effectors of calcium absorption include the oxalates in  certain plants, the tannins in tea, phytates in nuts, seeds, and grains,  and some fibers. Oxalates are found in high concentrations in  spinach, parsley, cocoa, and beets. In general, the calcium  bioavailability is inversely correlated to the oxalate content in foods.  High-fiber, low-fat diets also decrease the amount of calcium  absorbed, an effect likely related to how fiber and fat influence  the amount of time food stays in the gut. Anything that causes  diarrhea, including sickness, medications, and certain symptoms  related to old age, decreases the transit time of calcium in the  gut and therefore decreases calcium absorption. As we get older,  stomach acidity sometimes decreases, diarrhea occurs more often,  kidney function is impaired, and vitamin D absorption and activation  is compromised, all of which contribute to a decrease in calcium  bioavailability.  \\xa0 Table 10.2 Calcium Content and Bioavailability of Various Foods  Calcium  |  627'},\n",

These phosphate groups are essential  as a structural component of cell membranes (as phospholipids),  DNA and RNA, energy production (ATP), and regulation of acid- base homeostasis. Phosphorus however is mostly associated with  calcium as a part of the mineral structure of bones and teeth. \\xa0Blood  phosphorus levels are not controlled as strictly as calcium so the  PTH stimulates renal excretion of phosphate so that it does not  accumulate to toxic levels.  Dietary Reference Intakes for Phosphorus  In comparison to calcium, most Americans are not at risk for having  a phosphate deficiency. Phosphate is present in many foods popular  in the American diet including meat, fish, dairy products, processed  foods, and beverages. Phosphate is added to many foods because it  acts as an emulsifying agent, prevents clumping, improves texture  and taste, and extends shelf-life. The average intake of phosphorus  in US adults ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 milligrams per day,  well above the RDA of 700 milligrams per day.

Magnesium is not an integral part of the hard mineral  crystals, but it does reside on the surface of the crystal and helps  maximize bone structure. Observational studies link magnesium  deficiency with an increased risk for osteoporosis. A magnesium- deficient diet is associated with decreased levels of parathyroid  hormone and the activation of vitamin D, which may lead to an  impairment of bone remodeling. A study in nine hundred elderly  women and men did show that higher dietary intakes of magnesium  correlated to an increased BMD in the hip.1 Only a few clinical  trials have evaluated the effects of magnesium supplements on bone  health and their results suggest some modest benefits on BMD.  In addition to participating in bone maintenance, magnesium has  several other functions in the body.

Magnesium  plays a role in the synthesis of DNA and RNA, carbohydrates, and  lipids, and is essential for nerve conduction and muscle contraction.  Another health benefit of magnesium is that it may decrease blood  pressure.  Many Americans do not get the recommended intake of  magnesium from their diets. Some observational studies suggest  mild magnesium deficiency is linked to increased risk for  cardiovascular disease. Signs and symptoms of severe magnesium  deficiency may include tremor, muscle spasms, loss of appetite, and  nausea.  Dietary Reference Intakes for Magnesium  The RDAs for magnesium for adults between ages nineteen and  thirty are 400 milligrams per day for males and 310 milligrams per  day for females. For adults above age thirty, the RDA increases  slightly to 420 milligrams per day for males and 320 milligrams for  females.

Magnesium is also found in  high concentrations in fish, dairy products, meats, whole grains, and  nuts. Additionally chocolate, coffee, and hard water contain a good  amount of magnesium. Most people in America do not fulfill the RDA  for magnesium in their diets.

The iron in hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the capillaries of the  lungs and transports it to cells where the oxygen is released. If iron  level is low hemoglobin is not synthesized in sufficient amounts  and the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is reduced,  resulting in anemia. When iron levels are low in the diet the small  intestine more efficiently absorbs iron in an attempt to compensate  for the low dietary intake, but this process cannot make up for  the excessive loss of iron that occurs with chronic blood loss or  low intake. When blood cells are decommissioned for use, the body  recycles the iron back to the bone marrow where red blood cells  are made. The body stores some iron in the bone marrow, liver,  spleen, and skeletal muscle. A relatively small amount of iron is  excreted when cells lining the small intestine and skin cells die and  in blood loss, such as during menstrual bleeding. The lost iron must  be replaced from dietary sources.  The bioavailability of iron is highly dependent on dietary sources.  In animal-based foods about 60 percent of iron is bound to  hemoglobin, and heme iron is more bioavailable than nonheme iron.  The other 40 percent of iron in animal-based foods is nonheme,  which is the only iron source in plant-based foods. Some plants  contain chemicals (such as phytate, oxalates, tannins, and  polyphenols) that inhibit iron absorption. Although, eating fruits and  vegetables rich in vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing  foods markedly increases iron absorption. A review in the American  Journal of Clinical Nutrition reports that in developed countries iron  bioavailability from mixed diets ranges between 14 and 18 percent,  and that from vegetarian diets ranges between 5 and 12 percent.1  1.\\xa0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Iron and  Iron Deficiency.” Accessed October 2, 2011.  656  |  Iron'},\n",

Anemia is most often treated with iron supplements and increasing  the consumption of foods that are higher in iron. Iron supplements  have some adverse side effects including nausea, constipation,  diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Reducing the dose at first  and then gradually increasing to the full dose often minimizes the  side effects of iron supplements. Avoiding foods and beverages high  in phytates and also tea (which contains tannic acid and  polyphenols, both of which impair iron absorption), is important for  people who have iron-deficiency anemia. Eating a dietary source  of vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing foods improves  absorption of nonheme iron in the gut. Additionally, unknown  compounds that likely reside in muscle tissue of meat, poultry, and  fish increase iron absorption from both heme and nonheme  sources. See Table 17.2 “Enhancers and Inhibitors of Iron  Absorption” for more enhancers and inhibitors for iron absorption.

Preventing Iron-Deficiency Anemia  In young children iron-deficiency anemia can cause significant  motor, mental, and behavioral abnormalities that are long-lasting. In  the United States, the high incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in  infants and children was a major public-health problem prior to the  early 1970s, but now the incidence has been greatly reduced. This  achievement was accomplished by implementing the screening of  infants for iron-deficiency anemia in the health sector as a common  practice, advocating the fortification of infant formulas and cereals  with iron, and distributing them in supplemental food programs,  such as that within Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  Breastfeeding, iron supplementation, and delaying the introduction  of cow’s milk for at least the first twelve months of life were also  encouraged. These practices were implemented across the  socioeconomic spectrum and by the 1980s iron-deficiency anemia  in infants had significantly declined. Other solutions had to be  introduced in young children, who no longer were fed breast milk  or fortified formulas and were consuming cow’s milk. The following  solutions were introduced to parents: provide a diet rich in sources  of iron and vitamin C, limit cow’s milk consumption to less than  twenty-four ounces per day, and a multivitamin containing iron.

Zinc  also is a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism. As the  result of its prominent roles in anabolic and energy metabolism, a  zinc deficiency in infants and children blunts growth. The reliance  of growth on adequate dietary zinc was discovered in the early  1960s in the Middle East where adolescent nutritional dwarfism was  linked to diets containing high amounts of phytate. Cereal grains  and some vegetables contain chemicals, one being phytate, which  blocks the absorption of zinc and other minerals in the gut. It is  estimated that half of the world’s population has a zinc-deficient  diet.1  This is largely a consequence of the lack of red meat and seafood  in the diet and reliance on cereal grains as the main dietary staple.  In adults, severe zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, diarrhea, skin  sores, loss of appetite, and weight loss.

Some are enzymes involved in detoxifying free radicals and include  glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase. As an integral  functioning part of these enzymes, selenium aids in the  regeneration of glutathione and oxidized vitamin C. Selenium as  part of glutathione peroxidase also protects lipids from free  radicals, and, in doing so, spares vitamin E. This is just one example  of how antioxidants work together to protect the body against free- radical induced damage. Other functions of selenium-containing  proteins include protecting endothelial cells that line tissues,  converting the inactive thyroid hormone to the active form in cells,  and mediating inflammatory and immune system responses.  Observational  studies  have  demonstrated  that  selenium  deficiency is linked to an increased risk of cancer.

Low iodine levels and  consequently hypothyroidism has many signs and symptoms  including fatigue, sensitivity to cold, constipation, weight gain,  depression, and dry, itchy skin and paleness. The development of  goiter may often be the most visible sign of chronic iodine  deficiency, but the consequences of low levels of thyroid hormone  can be severe during infancy, childhood, and adolescence as it  affects all stages of growth and development. Thyroid hormone  plays a major role in brain development and growth and fetuses  and infants with severe iodine deficiency develop a condition known  as cretinism, in which physical and neurological impairment can  be severe.

Currently,  the results of scientific studies evaluating the usefulness of  chromium supplementation in preventing and treating Type 2  diabetes are largely inconclusive. More research is needed to better  determine if chromium is helpful in treating certain chronic  diseases and, if so, at what doses. If a deficiency of chromium occurs  in the body, signs and symptoms include weight loss, peripheral  neuropathy, elevated plasma glucose concentrations or impaired  glucose use, and high plasma free fatty acid concentrations.

Figure 11.7 A Severe Case of Fluorosis  Fluoride’s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well  substantiated, but the effects of fluoride on bone are not as well  known. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential  treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether  consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis  and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building  activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been  shown to increase BMD. In general, it appears that at low doses,  fluoride treatment increases BMD in people with osteoporosis and  is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of  calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug  Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of  osteoporosis mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known  and it has several side effects including frequent stomach upset and  joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much  greater than that in fluoridated water.  696  |  Fluoride'},\n",

This DRI system is used in both the United States  and Canada.  Dietary Reference Intakes: A Brief  Overview  “Dietary Reference Intakes” (DRI) is an umbrella term for four  reference values:  • Estimated Average Requirements (EAR)  • Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)  • Adequate Intakes (AI)  • Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL)  The DRIs are not minimum or maximum nutritional requirements  and are not intended to fit everybody. They are to be used as guides  only for the majority of the healthy population1.  1.\\xa0Deng S, West BJ, Jensen CJ. (2010).

This includes  people who are participating in programs such as the Special  Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The  DRI is not appropriate for people who are ill or malnourished, even  if they were healthy previously.  Determining Dietary Reference Intakes  Each DRI value is derived in a different way. See below for an  explanation of how each is determined:  1. Estimated Average Requirements. The EAR for a nutrient is  determined by a committee of nutrition experts who review  the scientific literature to determine a value that meets the  requirements of 50 percent of people in their target group  within a given life stage and for a particular sex. The  requirements of half of the group will fall below the EAR and  the other half will be above it. It is important to note that, for  each nutrient, a specific bodily function is chosen as the  criterion on which to base the EAR. For example, the EAR for  calcium is set using a criterion of maximizing bone health.  Thus, the EAR for calcium is set at a point that will meet the  needs, with respect to bone health, of half of the population.

              "  'text': 'EAR values become the scientific foundation upon which RDA  values are set.  2. Recommended Daily Allowances. Once the EAR of a nutrient  has been established, the RDA can be mathematically  determined. While the EAR is set at a point that meets the  needs of half the population, RDA values are set to meet the  needs of the vast majority (97 to 98 percent) of the target  healthy population. It is important to note that RDAs are not  the same thing as individual nutritional requirements. The  actual nutrient needs of a given individual will be different  than the RDA. However, since we know that 97 to 98 percent of  the population’s needs are met by the RDA, we can assume that  if a person is consuming the RDA of a given nutrient, they are  most likely meeting their nutritional need for that nutrient.  The important thing to remember is that the RDA is meant as a  recommendation and meeting the RDA means it is very likely  that you are meeting your actual requirement for that nutrient.  Understanding the Difference  There is a distinct difference between a requirement and a  recommendation. For instance, the DRI for vitamin D is a  recommended 600 international units each day. However, in order  to find out your true personal requirements for vitamin D, a blood  test is necessary. The blood test will provide an accurate reading  from which a medical professional can gauge your required daily  vitamin D amounts. This may be considerably more or less than the  DRI, depending on what your level actually is.  1. Adequate Intake. AIs are created for nutrients when there is  insufficient consistent scientific evidence to set an EAR for the  entire population. As with RDAs, AIs can be used as nutrient- intake goals for a given nutrient. For example, there has not  712  |  Understanding Dietary Reference Intakes'},\n",

Consequently, all of the  DRI values for infants are AIs derived from nutrient values in  human breast milk. For older babies and children, AI values are  derived from human milk coupled with data on adults. The AI is  meant for a healthy target group and is not meant to be  sufficient for certain at-risk groups, such as premature infants.  2. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels. The UL was established to help  distinguish healthful and harmful nutrient intakes. Developed  in part as a response to the growing usage of dietary  supplements, ULs indicate the highest level of continuous  intake of a particular nutrient that may be taken without  causing health problems. When a nutrient does not have any  known issue if taken in excessive doses, it is not assigned a UL.  However, even when a nutrient does not have a UL it is not  necessarily safe to consume in large amounts.  Figure 12.1 DRI Graph  This graph illustrates the risks of nutrient inadequacy and nutrient  excess as we move from a low intake of a nutrient to a high intake.  Starting on the left side of the graph, you can see that when you  have a very low intake of a nutrient, your risk of nutrient deficiency  is high. As your nutrient intake increases, the chances that you  will be deficient in that nutrient decrease. The point at which 50  Understanding Dietary Reference Intakes  |  713'},\n",

Also, the values are meant to assess and plan  average intake over time; that is, you don’t need to meet  these recommendations every single day—meeting them on  average over several days is sufficient.

In the United States, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act  (NLEA) passed in 1990 and came into effect in 1994. In Canada,  mandatory labeling came into effect in 2005. As a result, all  packaged foods sold in the United States and Canada must have  nutrition labels that accurately reflect the contents of the food  products. There are several mandated nutrients and some optional  ones that manufacturers or packagers include.  In May, 2016 a new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods,  beverages and dietary supplements was announced. This label  reflects new scientific information and will make it easier for  consumers to make informed food choices. Some of the changes  made to the label include:  • Increased type size for “Calories,” “servings per container,” and  “Serving size.”  • Bolded type for the number of calories and the “Serving size.”  • Actual amounts of vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (in  addition to the Daily Value amounts) are required to be listed.  Vitamins A and C are now voluntary.  • Improved footnote to better explain that the Daily Value is  based on a 2,000 calories a day diet.  718  |  Discovering Nutrition Facts'},\n",

All other values listed thereafter, from the calories to the  dietary fiber, are based on this one serving. On the panel, the  serving size is followed by the number of calories and then a list  of selected nutrients. You will also see “Percent Daily Value” on the  far right-hand side. This helps you determine if the food is a good  source of a particular nutrient or not.  The Daily Value (DV) represents the recommended amount of  a given nutrient based on the RDA of that nutrient in a  2,000-kilocalorie diet. The DV was updated as part of the new  nutrition facts label announced in May 2016. The updated DV applies  to packaged food, beverages and dietary supplements that contain  ingredients with a DV.\\xa0The percentage of Daily Value (percent DV)  represents the proportion of the total daily recommended amount  that you will get from one serving of the food. For example, in the  older food label in Figure 12.2 “Reading the Older Nutrition Label,”  the percent DV of calcium for one serving of macaroni-and-cheese  is 20 percent, which means that one serving of macaroni and cheese  provides 20 percent of the daily recommended calcium intake. Since  the DV for calcium is 1,300 milligrams, the food producer  determined the percent DV for calcium by taking the calcium  content in milligrams in each serving, and dividing it by 1,300  milligrams, and then multiplying it by 100 to get it into percentage  format. Whether you consume 2,000 calories per day or not you can  still use the percent DV as a target reference.  Generally, a percent DV of 5 is considered low and a percent  DV of 20 is considered high. This means, as a general rule, for fat,  saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium, look for foods with  a low percent DV. Alternatively, when concentrating on essential  mineral or vitamin intake, look for a high percent DV. To figure  out your fat allowance remaining for the day after consuming one  serving of macaroni-and-cheese, look at the percent DV for fat,  which is 18 percent, and subtract it from 100 percent. To know this  amount in grams of fat, read the footnote of the food label to find  that the recommended maximum amount of fat grams to consume  720  |  Discovering Nutrition Facts'},\n",

A health claim  is a statement that links a particular food with a reduced risk of  developing disease. \\xa0Implied health claims include the use of  symbols, statements and other forms of communication that  suggest a relationship between a food\\xa0 substance and disease  reduction. As such, health claims such as “Three grams of soluble  fiber from oatmeal daily in combination with a diet low in  cholesterol and saturated fat may reduce the risk of heart disease,”  must be evaluated by the FDA before it may appear on packaging.  Prior to the passage of the NLEA products that made such claims  were categorized as drugs and not food. All health claims must be  substantiated by scientific evidence in order for it to be approved  and put on a food label. To avoid having companies making false  claims, laws also regulate how health claims are presented on food  packaging. In addition to the claim being backed up by scientific  evidence, it may never claim to diagnose, mitigate, cure or treat  the disease.

These eight common allergens  are as follows: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and  wheat. (More information on these allergens will be discussed in  Chapter 18 “Nutritional Issues”.) The FDA does not require warnings  that cross contamination may occur during packaging, however  most manufacturers include this advisory as a courtesy. For  instance, you may notice a label that states, “This product is  manufactured in a factory that also processes peanuts.” If you have  food allergies, it is best to avoid products that may have been  contaminated with the allergen.

Fill a quarter of your plate with whole grains such as 100 percent  whole-grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, and pasta. Half of your  daily grain intake should be whole grains. Read the ingredients list  on food labels carefully to determine if a food is comprised of whole  grains.  Select a variety of protein foods to improve nutrient intake and  promote health benefits. Each week, be sure to include a nice array  of protein sources in your diet, such as nuts, seeds, beans, legumes,  poultry, soy, and seafood. The recommended consumption amount  for seafood for adults is two 4-ounce servings per week. When  choosing meat, select lean cuts. Be conscious to prepare meats  using little or no added saturated fat, such as butter.  If you enjoy drinking milk or eating milk products, such as cheese  and yogurt, choose low-fat or nonfat products. Low-fat and nonfat  products contain the same amount of calcium and other essential  nutrients as whole-milk products, but with much less fat and  calories.

Discretionary Calories  When following a balanced, healthful diet with many nutrient-dense  foods, you may consume enough of your daily nutrients before  you reach your daily calorie limit. The remaining calories are  discretionary (to be used according to your best judgment). To find  out your discretionary calorie allowance, add up all the calories  you consumed to achieve the recommended nutrient intakes and  then subtract this number from your recommended daily caloric  allowance. For example, someone who has a recommended  2,000-calorie per day diet may eat enough nutrient-dense foods  to meet requirements after consuming only 1,814 calories. The  remaining 186 calories are discretionary. See Table 12.5 “Sample  Menu Plan Containing 2,000 Calories”.

All of the  scores are added up from the different food categories and the  diets are given a HEI score.

This is why, in 2003, the WHO and the Food and Agricultural  Organization of the United Nations launched a campaign to  promote fruit and vegetable intake worldwide.  Antioxidant Variety in Food Provides  Health Benefits  Not only has the several-billion-dollar supplement industry  inundated us with FDA-unapproved health claims, but science is  continuously advancing and providing us with a multitude of  promising health benefits from particular fruits, vegetables, teas,  herbs, and spices. For instance, blueberries protect against  cardiovascular disease, an apple or pear a day reduces stroke risk by  over 52 percent, eating more carrots significantly reduces the risk of  bladder cancer, drinking tea reduces cholesterol and helps glucose  homeostasis, and cinnamon blocks infection and reduces the risk of  some cancers. However, recall that science also tells us that no one  nutrient alone is shown to provide these effects.  What micronutrient and phytochemical sources are best at  protecting against chronic disease? All of them, together. Just as  there is no wonder supplement or drug, there is no superior fruit,  vegetable, spice, herb, or tea that protects against all diseases. A  review in the July–August 2010 issue of Oxidative Medicine and  Cellular Longevity concludes that the plant-food benefits to health  are  attributed  to  two  main  factors—that  nutrients  and  phytochemicals are present at low concentrations in general, and  that the complex mixtures of nutrients and phytochemicals  provides additive and synergistic effects4.

The first Food and Nutrition Board was  created in 1941, and in the same year set recommendations for the  adequate intakes of caloric energy and eight essential nutrients.  These were disseminated to officials responsible for food relief for  armed forces and civilians supporting the war effort. Since 1980,  the dietary guidelines have been reevaluated and updated every  five years by the advisory committees of the US Department of  Agriculture (USDA) and the US Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS).

Establishing requirements means that the public health and  clinical significance of intake levels – both deficiency and excess  – and associated disease patterns for each nutrient, need to be  thoroughly reviewed for all age groups.

These guidelines  are from the review of thousands of scientific journal articles by  a consensus panel consisting of more than two thousand nutrition  experts with the overall mission of improving the health of the  nation1.

It begins with the first trimester (weeks one to  week twelve), extends into the second trimester (weeks thirteen  to week twenty-seven), and ends with the third trimester (week  twenty-eight to birth). At conception, a sperm cell fertilizes an egg  cell, creating a zygote. The zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells  to become an embryo and implants itself in the uterine wall, where,  by the end of the 8th week after conception, it develops into a  fetus. Some of the major changes that occur include the branching  of nerve cells to form primitive neural pathways at eight weeks. At  the twenty-week mark, physicians typically perform an ultrasound  to acquire information about the fetus and check for abnormalities.  By this time, it is possible to know the sex of the baby. At twenty- eight weeks, the unborn baby begins to add body fat in preparation  for life outside of the womb.2\\xa0Journey Across the LifeSpan: Human  Development and Health Promotion.

Therefore, it is crucial to  make careful dietary choices.  The Early Days of Pregnancy  For medical purposes, pregnancy is measured from the first day of  a woman’s last menstrual period until childbirth, and typically lasts  about forty weeks. Major changes begin to occur in the earliest  days, often weeks before a woman even knows that she is pregnant.  During this period, adequate nutrition supports cell division, tissue  differentiation, and organ development. As each week passes, new  milestones are reached. Therefore, women who are trying to  conceive should make proper dietary choices to ensure the delivery  of a healthy baby. Fathers-to-be should also consider their eating  habits. A sedentary lifestyle and a diet low in fresh fruits and  vegetables may affect male fertility. Men who drink too much  alcohol may also damage the quantity and quality of their sperm.1.  For both men and women, adopting healthy habits also boosts  general well-being and makes it possible to meet the demands of  parenting.  1.\\xa0Healthy Sperm: Improving Your Fertility.

Therefore, it is important  for all women of  childbearing age to get  400 micrograms of folate  per day prior to  pregnancy and 600  micrograms per day  during pregnancy. Folate,  which is also known as  folic acid, is crucial for the production of DNA and RNA  and the formation of cells. A deficiency can cause  megaloblastic anemia, or the development of abnormal  red blood cells, in pregnant women. It can also have a  profound effect on the unborn baby. Typically, folate  intake has the greatest impact during the first eight  weeks of pregnancy, when the neural tube closes. The  neural tube develops into the fetus’s brain and spinal  cord, and adequate folate reduces the risk of brain  abnormalities and neural tube defects, which occur in  one in a thousand pregnancies in North America each  year. This vital nutrient also supports the spinal cord  and its protective coverings. Inadequate folic acid can  result in birth defects, such as spina bifida, which is the  failure of the spinal column to close.

One  of the most notable and significant changes is weight gain. If a  pregnant woman does not gain enough weight, her unborn baby  will be at risk. Poor weight gain, especially in the second and third  trimesters, could result not only in low birth weight, but also infant  mortality and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, it is vital for a  pregnant woman to maintain a healthy amount of weight gain. Her  weight prior to pregnancy also has a major effect. Infant birth  weight is one of the best indicators of a baby’s future health.  Pregnant women of normal prepregnancy weight should gain  between 25 and 35 pounds in total through the entire pregnancy.  The precise amount that a mother should gain usually depends on  her beginning weight or body mass index (BMI).

Pregnant women with a prepregnancy BMI  above thirty have an increased risk for a cesarean section during  delivery. Therefore, it is optimal to have a BMI in the normal range  prior to pregnancy.  Generally, women gain 2 to 5 pounds in the first trimester. After  that, it is best not to gain more than one pound per week.

Weight Loss after Pregnancy  During labor, new mothers lose some of the weight they gained  during pregnancy with the delivery of their child. In the following  weeks, they continue to shed weight as they lose accumulated fluids  and their blood volume returns to normal. Some studies have  hypothesized that breastfeeding also helps a new mother lose some  of the extra weight, although research is ongoing.5.

Pregnant  women must consume more calories and nutrients in the second  and third trimesters than other adult women. However, the average  recommended daily caloric intake can vary depending on activity  level and the mother’s normal weight. Also, pregnant women should  choose a high-quality, diverse diet, consume fresh foods, and  prepare nutrient-rich meals. Steaming is one of the best ways to  cook vegetables. Vitamins are destroyed by overcooking, whereas  uncooked vegetables and fruits have the highest vitamin content.  It is also recommended for pregnant women to take prenatal  supplements  to  ensure  adequate  intake  of  the  needed  micronutrients.  Energy and Macronutrients  During the first trimester, a pregnant woman has the same energy  requirements as normal and should consume the same number of  calories as usual. However, as the pregnancy progresses, a woman  must increase her caloric intake. According to the IOM, she should  consume an additional 340 calories per day during the second  trimester, and an additional 450 calories per day during the third  trimester. This is partly due to an increase in metabolism, which  occurs during pregnancy and contributes to increased energy  needs. A woman can easily meet these increased needs by  consuming more nutrient-dense foods.  The recommended daily allowance, or RDA, of carbohydrates  during pregnancy is about 175 to 265 grams per day to fuel fetal  brain development. The best food sources for pregnant women  include whole-grain breads and cereals, brown rice, root vegetables,  legumes, and fruits. These and other unrefined carbohydrates  792  |  Pregnancy'},\n",

Protein builds muscle and other  tissues, enzymes, antibodies, and hormones in both the mother and  the unborn baby. Additional protein also supports increased blood  volume and the production of amniotic fluid. The RDA of protein  during pregnancy is 71 grams per day, which is 25 grams above the  normal recommendation. Protein should be derived from healthy  sources, such as lean red meat, poultry, legumes, nuts, seeds, eggs,  and fish. Low-fat milk and other dairy products also provide protein,  along with calcium and other nutrients.  There are no specific recommendations for fats in pregnancy,  apart from following normal dietary guidelines. Although this is  the case, it is recommended to increase the amount of essential  fatty acids linoleic acid and ∝-linolenic acid because they are  incorporated into the placenta and fetal tissues.\\xa0 Fats should make  up 25 to 35 percent of daily calories, and those calories should  come from healthy fats, such as avocados and salmon.

Many of these nutrient requirements are  higher yet for pregnant mothers who are in their teen years due to  higher needs for their own growth in addition to the growth of the  fetus.  There is an increased need for all B vitamins during pregnancy.  Adequate vitamin B6 supports the metabolism of amino acids, while  more vitamin B12 is needed for the synthesis of red blood cells and  DNA. Also remember that folate needs increase during pregnancy  to 600 micrograms per day to prevent neural tube defects. This  micronutrient is crucial for fetal development because it also helps  produce the extra blood a woman’s body requires during pregnancy.  Additional zinc is crucial for cell development and protein  synthesis.

Iron is the one  micronutrient that is almost impossible to obtain in adequate  amounts from food sources only. Therefore, even if a pregnant  woman consumes a healthy diet, there still is a need to take an iron  supplement, in the form of ferrous salts.  For most other minerals, recommended intakes are similar to  those for nonpregnant women, although it is crucial for pregnant  women to make sure to meet the RDAs to reduce the risk of birth  defects.

To prevent  preeclampsia, the WHO recommends increasing calcium intake for  women consuming diets low in that micronutrient, administering  a low dosage of aspirin (75 milligrams), and increasing prenatal  checkups. The WHO does not recommend the restriction of dietary  salt intake during pregnancy with the aim of preventing the  development of pre-eclampsia and its complications12.  About 4 percent of pregnant women suffer from a condition  known as gestational diabetes, which is abnormal glucose tolerance  during pregnancy. The body becomes resistant to the hormone  insulin, which enables cells to transport glucose from the blood.  Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed around twenty-four to  twenty-six weeks, although it is possible for the condition to  develop later into a pregnancy. Signs and symptoms of this disease  include extreme hunger, thirst, or fatigue. If blood sugar levels are  not properly monitored and treated, the baby might gain too much  weight and require a cesarean delivery. Diet and regular physical  activity can help to manage this condition. Most patients who suffer  from gestational diabetes also require daily insulin injections to  boost the absorption of glucose from the bloodstream and promote  the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen in liver and muscle  cells. Gestational diabetes usually resolves after childbirth, although  women who experience this condition are more likely to develop  Type 2 diabetes later in life, particularly if they are overweight.13.  12.\\xa0WHO Recommendations for Prevention and Treatment  of Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia.World Health  Organization. http:/ /whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/ 2011/9789241548335_eng.pdf.

All of these changes require adequate  nutrition to ensure development at the appropriate rate.8  Healthy infants grow steadily, but not always at an even pace. For  example, during the first year of life, height increases by 50 percent,  while weight triples. Physicians and other health professionals use  growth charts to track a baby’s development process. Because  infants cannot stand, length is used instead of height to determine  the rate of a child’s growth. Other important developmental  measurements include head circumference and weight. All of these  must be tracked and compared against standard measurements for  an infant’s age.  In the US, for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of  age, the WHO growth charts are used to monitor growth. These  standards represent optimal growth for children at this age and  allow for tracking growth trends over time through percentile  rankings. Growth charts may provide warnings that a child has a  medical problem or is malnourished. Growth that is too rapid can  increase the risk for overweight and obesity in childhood and later  in life. Insufficient weight or height gain during infancy may indicate  a condition known as failure-to-thrive (FTT), which is characterized  by poor growth. FTT can happen at any age, but in infancy, it  typically occurs after six months. Some causes include poverty, lack  of enough food, feeding inappropriate foods, and excessive intake of  fruit juice.

Breast  milk is also low in vitamin K11Pediatric clinics of North America, 60(1),  49–74., which is required for blood clotting, and deficits could lead  to bleeding or hemorrhagic disease. Babies are born with limited  vitamin K, so supplementation may be needed initially and some  states require a vitamin K injection after birth.

A tiny muscle  surrounds each of the alveoli; when a baby nurses at the breast,  a hormone is released from the mother’s brain that makes these  muscles contract and push the milk out into the ducts and towards  820  |  Infancy'},\n",

The breast contains 15 to 25 lobes,  and each lobe contains 10 to 100 alveoli.  The areola is the darker skin around the nipple and is a visual  target that helps the baby find the breast. The bumps on the areola  are glands that provide lubrication and protection to the tissue.  These glands also produce a scent to help the baby find the nipple.  The nipple and areola contain erectile smooth muscles that contract  to make the nipple protrude more during breastfeeding. Nipples  come in many sizes and shapes and contain from 4 to 18 openings  for the milk to flow out. Mothers do not need to do anything to get  their nipples ready to breastfeed.  Breast size is mainly determined by the amount of fat in the  breast; the milk-making structures don’t vary as much as the  amount of fat tissue. Most mothers can make enough milk for their  babies whether they have small or large breasts. It is normal for a  woman to have one breast that is different than the other in size  or shape. During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in  size. If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during  pregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or  a lactation consultant.  After the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to  ensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy  into childhood. Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for  rapid growth and development. As a result, the WHO recommends  that breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first  six months of an infant’s life. Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the  best ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health  of her infant child. Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients  that a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy  life. Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over  80% of women start to breastfeed their infants.

This is particularly true for women who breastfeed  their babies, which increases the need in certain nutrients.  Lactation  Preparation for making breast milk, although begun in puberty, is  not completed until a woman’s first pregnancy. Early in the first  trimester, the cells that will secrete milk divide and multiply.  Hormones play a major role in preparing the woman’s body to  breastfeed, particularly during the second and third trimesters. At  that point, levels of the hormone prolactin increase to stimulate the  growth of the milk duct system, which initiates and maintains milk  production. Also during pregnancy, progesterone stimulates growth  of the alveoli, the clusters of cells where the milk is made. During  this process ducts that will carry the milk grow larger and branch  out, and new capillaries are also formed to circulate the increased  blood supply.

Shortly after birth, the expulsion of the  placenta triggers progesterone levels to fall, which activates  lactation.15 When the infant suckles at the breast, levels of the  hormone oxytocin rise to promote the release of breast milk from  the breast when the infant suckles, which is known as the milk- ejection reflex.  New mothers usually find that their appetite and thirst is greater  than before pregnancy; it is recommended that they still focus on  nutrient-dense foods to nourish their body and replace their body’s  nutrient stores. A conservative rate of weight loss (1-2 pounds per  week) during lactation does not usually impact the quantity or  quality of breast milk, but maternal deficiencies in some nutrients  have been described during lactation. The nutrient content of  breastmilk does not change much based upon maternal diet for  most nutrients. The RDA for energy is 330 additional Calories during  the first six months of lactation and 400 additional Calories during  the second six months of lactation. The energy needed to support  breastfeeding comes from both increased intake and from stored  fat. For example, during the first six months after her baby is born,  the daily caloric cost for a lactating mother is 500 Calories, with  330 calories derived from increased intake and 170 Calories derived  from maternal fat stores. This helps explain why breastfeeding may  promote weight loss in new mothers. Lactating women should also  drink 3.1 liters of liquids per day (about 13 cups) to avoid  dehydration, according to the IOM.

In addition, breast  milk is rich in cholesterol, which is needed for brain development. It  is helpful to know the different types and components of breastmilk,  along with the nutrients they provide to enable an infant to survive  and thrive.  Colostrum is the milk produced immediately after birth, prior  to the start of mature milk production, and lasts for two to five  days after the arrival of the baby. Cells in the breast can begin to  secrete colostrum by mid-pregnancy. During the last trimester, the  alveoli (grape-like clusters of cells that produce milk) can become  swollen with colostrum. Colostrum is thicker than mature breast  milk, and is yellowish or creamy in color. This protein-rich liquid  fulfills an infant’s nutrient needs during those early days. Although  low in volume, colostrum is packed with concentrated nutrition for  newborns. This special milk is high in fat-soluble vitamins, minerals,  and immunoglobulins (antibodies) that pass from the mother to the  baby. Immunoglobulins provide passive immunity for the newborn  and protect the baby from bacterial and viral diseases.16 Colostrum  also helps the baby to eliminate waste (meconium).  Two to four days after birth, colostrum is replaced by transitional  milk. Nursing the baby early (within the first hour of birth) and  frequently (8 to 14 times per 24 hours) helps to bring in this  increased volume of milk sooner. Transitional milk is a creamy,  usually yellow liquid that lasts for approximately two weeks and  includes high levels of fat, lactose, and water-soluble vitamins.

Its  composition varies from morning to night, from the beginning of  the feeding to the end, and from early postpartum to later in infancy  and toddlerhood. Breastmilk that is produced by mothers of  premature infants is higher in protein and calcium to meet the  needs of the preemie. Foremilk (the milk that comes at the  beginning of a feeding) tends to be lower in fat. Hind-milk comes  towards the end of a feeding containing higher levels of fat, which  helps the baby to feel satisfied and full. Combined, these two types  of milk ensure that a baby receives adequate nutrients to grow and  develop properly.18  About 87.5 percent of mature milk is water, which helps an infant  remain hydrated. The other 12.5 percent contains carbohydrates,  proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals which support energy and  growth. Similar to cow’s milk, the main carbohydrate of mature  breast milk is lactose.

Although  the absolute amounts of some micronutrients are low, they are  more efficiently absorbed by infants from breast milk. Other  essential components include digestive enzymes that help a baby  digest the breast milk. Human milk also provides the hormones and  growth factors that help a newborn to develop.  Diet and Milk Quality  A mother’s health habits can impact milk production and quality. As  during pregnancy, lactating mothers should avoid illegal substances  and cigarettes. Some legal drugs and herbal products can be  harmful as well, so it is helpful to discuss them with a healthcare  professional. In some rare cases, mothers may need to avoid certain  things, such as dairy or spicy foods, that can produce gas in  sensitive infants.

As a result, breastfeeding boosts  the baby’s immune system and lowers the incidence of diarrhea,  respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal infections, and ear infections.  Breastfed babies also are less likely to develop asthma and allergies,  and breastfeeding lowers the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.  In addition, human milk encourages the growth of a healthy  microbiome (the bacteria in an infant’s intestinal tract). Most of  these benefits remain after an infant has been weaned from breast  milk. Some studies suggest other possible long-term effects.

This type of formula uses hydrolyzed  protein, meaning that the protein is broken down into amino acids  and small peptides, which makes it easier to digest, and makes it less  likely to trigger gastrointestinal distress.  Preterm infant formulas are given to premature and low birth  weight infants, if breast milk is unavailable. Preterm infant formulas  have 24 calories per fluid ounce and are given until the infant  reaches a desired weight. These formulas are also higher in protein,  calcium, and phosphorus to meet the special needs of premature  infants.  Infant formula comes in three basic types:  1. Powder that requires mixing with water. This is the least  expensive type of formula.  2. Concentrates, which are liquids that must be diluted with  water. This type is slightly more expensive.  3. Ready-to-use liquids that can be poured directly into bottles.  This is the most expensive type of formula. However, it  requires no preparation. Ready-to-use formulas are used when  a safe and sanitary water supply is not available. Ready-to-use  formulas are also convenient for traveling.  Most babies need about 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body  weight each day. Therefore, the average infant consumes about 24  fluid ounces of breastmilk or formula per day, or one ounce per  hour. If an infant sleeps for 2 hours, they often consume 2 ounces  Infancy  |  835'},\n",

When preparing  formula, parents and caregivers should carefully follow the mixing  instructions and safety guidelines, since an infant has an immature  immune system. All equipment used in formula preparation should  be sterilized for newborns, and especially premature infants.  Prepared, unused formula should be refrigerated to prevent  bacterial growth. A partially finished bottle of infant formula should  be discarded after 1 hour. Parents must make sure not to use  contaminated water to mix formula in order to prevent foodborne  or other illnesses. Follow the instructions for powdered and  concentrated formula carefully—formula that is overly diluted will  not  provide  adequate  calories  and  protein,  while  overly  concentrated formula provides too much protein and too little  water which can challenge immature kidneys and lead to  dehydration.

Infants should not consume solid foods prior to six months  because most solids are less nutritious than breastmilk. Eating  solids before 6 months of age usually means drinking less breast  milk and is associated with more ear infections and respiratory  infections. If parents try to feed an infant who is too young or is not  ready, their tongue will push the food out; this is called an extrusion  reflex. After six months, the suck-swallow reflexes are not as strong,  and infants can hold up their heads and move them around, both of  which make eating solid foods more feasible.  Solid baby foods can be bought commercially or prepared from  regular food using a food processor, blender, food mill, or grinder at  home. By nine months to a year, infants are able to chew soft foods  and can eat solids that are well chopped or mashed. Infants who are  fed solid foods before 4 months of age are susceptible to developing  food allergies. Therefore, as parents and caregivers introduce solids,  they should feed their child only one new food at a time, to help  identify allergic responses or food intolerances. An iron supplement  is also recommended at this time. Rice is no longer recommended  for a first infant food because of its high arsenic content.

However, toddlers experience enormous intellectual, emotional,  and social changes. Of course, food and nutrition continue to play  an important role in a child’s development. During this stage, the  diet completely shifts from breastfeeding or bottle-feeding to solid  foods along with healthy juices and other liquids. Parents of toddlers  also need to be mindful of certain nutrition-related issues that may  crop up during this stage of the human life cycle. For example, fluid  requirements relative to body size are higher in toddlers than in  adults because children are at greater risk of dehydration.  The toddler years pose interesting challenges for parents or other  caregivers, as children learn how to eat on their own and begin to  develop personal preferences. However, with the proper diet and  guidance, toddlers can continue to grow and develop at a healthy  rate.  Nutritional Requirements  MyPlate may be used as a guide for the toddler’s diet  (http:/ /www.choosemyplate.gov/preschoolers.html). A toddler’s  serving sizes should be approximately one-quarter that of an adult’s.  One way to estimate serving sizes for young children is one  tablespoon for each year of life. For example, a two-year-old child  would be served 2 tablespoons of fruits or vegetables at a meal,  while a four-year-old would be given 4 tablespoons, or a quarter  cup. Here is an example of a toddler-sized meal:  • 1 ounce of meat or chicken, or 2 to 3 tablespoons of beans  • One-quarter slice of whole-grain bread  • 1 to 2 tablespoons of cooked vegetable  • 1 to 2 tablespoons of fruit  Toddler Years  |  853'},\n",

Toddlers’ needs increase to support their  body and brain development. The RDA of protein is 5 to 20 percent  of daily calories (13 to 50 grams for 1,000 daily calories).

Essential fatty acids are vital for the  development of the eyes, along with nerve and other types of tissue.  However, toddlers should not consume foods with high amounts of  trans fats and saturated fats. Instead, young children require the  equivalent of 3 teaspoons of healthy oils, such as canola oil, each  day.  Micronutrients  As a child grows bigger, the demands for micronutrients increase.  These needs for vitamins and minerals can be met with a balanced  diet, with a few exceptions. According to the American Academy of  Pediatrics, toddlers and children of all ages need 600 international  units of vitamin D per day. Vitamin D-fortified milk and cereals can  help to meet this need. However, toddlers who do not get enough of  this micronutrient should receive a supplement.

During this phase, it is important to offer  children foods that they can handle on their own and that help them  avoid choking and other hazards. Examples include fresh fruits that  have been sliced into pieces, orange or grapefruit sections, peas  or potatoes that have been mashed for safety, a cup of yogurt,  and whole-grain bread or bagels cut into pieces.

According to Satter, parents are  responsible for what their infants eat, while infants are responsible  for how much they eat. In the toddler years and beyond, parents are  responsible for what they offer their children to eat, when they eat,  and where they eat, while children are responsible for how much  food they eat and whether they eat. Satter states that the role of a  parent or a caregiver in feeding includes the following:  • selecting and preparing food  • providing regular meals and snacks  • making mealtimes pleasant  • showing children what they must learn about mealtime  behavior  • avoiding letting children eat in between meal- or snack-times2  Picky Eaters  The parents of toddlers are likely to notice a sharp drop in their  child’s appetite.

They also can be unpredictable  about what they want to consume for specific meals or at particular  times of the day. Although it may seem as if toddlers should increase  their food intake to match their level of activity, there is a good  reason for picky eating. A child’s growth rate slows after infancy, and  toddlers ages two and three do not require as much food.  One way to encourage a picky eater to try healthy foods is to get  them involved in age-appropriate tasks in meal preparation.

One is a lack of time. Parents and  other caregivers who are constantly on the go may find it difficult  to fit home-cooked meals into a busy schedule and may turn to  fast food and other conveniences that are quick and easy, but not  nutritionally sound. Another contributing factor is a lack of access  to fresh fruits and vegetables. This is a problem particularly in low- income neighborhoods where local stores and markets may not  stock fresh produce or may have limited options. Physical inactivity  is also a factor, as toddlers who live a sedentary lifestyle are more  likely to be overweight or obese. Another contributor is a lack of  breastfeeding support. Children who were breastfed as infants have  lower rates of obesity than children who were bottle-fed.  To prevent or address toddler obesity parents and caregivers can  do the following:  • Eat at the kitchen table instead of in front of a television to  monitor what and how much a child eats.  • Offer a child healthy portions. The size of a toddler’s fist is an  appropriate serving size.  • Plan time for physical activity, about sixty minutes or more per  day. Toddlers should have no more than sixty minutes of  sedentary activity, such as watching television, per day.

Parents also need to instruct a child  on brushing their teeth at this time to help a toddler develop healthy  habits and avoid tooth decay. Generally, children need help brushing  their teeth until they are 5 years old.  Iron-Deficiency Anemia  An infant who switches to solid foods, but does not eat enough  iron-rich foods, can develop iron-deficiency anemia. This condition  occurs when an iron-deprived body cannot produce enough  hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen  throughout the body. The inadequate supply of hemoglobin for new  blood cells results in anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a  number of problems including weakness, pale skin, shortness of  breath, and irritability. It can also result in intellectual, behavioral,  or motor problems. In infants and toddlers, iron-deficiency anemia  can occur as young children are weaned from iron-rich foods, such  as breast milk and iron-fortified formula. They begin to eat solid  foods that may not provide enough of this nutrient. As a result,  their iron stores become diminished at a time when this nutrient is  critical for brain growth and development.  \\xa0 9.\\xa0Ervin, R. B., Kit, B. K., Carroll, M. D., & Ogden, C. L.

Although milk is  critical for the bone-building calcium that it provides, intake should  not exceed the RDA to avoid displacing foods rich with iron.  Children may also be given a daily supplement, using infant vitamin  drops with iron or ferrous sulfate drops. If iron-deficiency anemia  does occur, treatment includes a dosage of 3 milligrams per  kilogram once daily before breakfast, usually in the form of a ferrous  sulfate syrup.

Other changes  that affect nutrition include the influence of peers on dietary  choices and the kinds of foods offered by schools and afterschool  programs, which can make up a sizable part of a child’s diet. Food- related problems for young children can include tooth decay, food  sensitivities, and malnourishment. Also, excessive weight gain early  in life can lead to obesity into adolescence and adulthood.  At this life stage, a healthy diet facilitates physical and mental  development and helps to maintain health and wellness. School- aged children experience steady, consistent growth, with an average  growth rate of 2–3 inches (5–7 centimeters) in height and 4.5–6.5  pounds (2–3 kilograms) in weight per year. In addition, the rate  of growth for the extremities is faster than for the trunk, which  results in more adult-like proportions. Long-bone growth stretches  muscles and ligaments, which results in many children experiencing  “growing pains,” at night, in particular.1  Energy  Children’s energy needs vary, depending on their growth and level  of physical activity. Energy requirements also vary according to  gender.

At this time, parents can also educate  children about kitchen safety. It might be helpful to cut sandwiches,  meats, or pancakes into small or interesting shapes.

In the United States, about 20 percent of households  with children are food insecure to some degree. In half of those,  only adults experience food insecurity, while in the other half both  adults and children are considered to be food insecure, which  means that children did not have access to adequate, nutritious  meals at times.3  Growing up in a food-insecure household can lead to a number  of problems. Deficiencies in iron, zinc, protein, and vitamin A can  result in stunted growth, illness, and limited development. Federal  programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, the School  Breakfast Program, and Summer Feeding Programs, work to address  the risk of hunger and malnutrition in school-aged children. They  help to fill the gaps and provide children living in food-insecure  households with greater access to nutritious meals.  The National School Lunch Program  Beginning with preschool, children consume at least one of their  meals in a school setting. Many children receive both breakfast and  lunch outside of the home. Therefore, it is important for schools  to provide meals that are nutritionally sound. In the United States,  more than thirty-one million children from low-income families  are given meals provided by the National School Lunch Program.

Recent studies show that three million children  under age eighteen are allergic to at least one type of food.6  Some of the most common allergenic foods include peanuts, milk,  eggs, soy, wheat, and shellfish. An allergy occurs when a protein  in food triggers an immune response, which results in the release  of antibodies, histamine, and other defenders that attack foreign  bodies. Possible symptoms include itchy skin, hives, abdominal pain,  vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. Symptoms usually develop within  minutes to hours after consuming a food allergen. Children can  outgrow a food allergy, especially allergies to wheat, milk, eggs, or  soy.  Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction that results in difficulty  breathing, swelling in the mouth and throat, decreased blood  pressure, shock, or even death. Milk, eggs, wheat, soybeans, fish,  shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts are the most likely to trigger this  type of response. A dose of the drug epinephrine is often  administered via a “pen” to treat a person who goes into  anaphylactic shock.7  Some children experience a food intolerance, which does not  involve an immune response.

Symptoms of  lactose intolerance usually affect the GI tract and can include  bloating, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, and diarrhea. An intolerance  is best managed by making dietary changes and avoiding any foods  that trigger the reaction.8  The Threat of Lead Toxicity  There is a danger of lead toxicity, or lead poisoning, among school- aged children. Lead is found in plumbing in old homes, in lead-based  paint, and occasionally in the soil. Contaminated food and water can  increase exposure and result in hazardous lead levels in the blood.  Children under age six are especially vulnerable. They may consume  items tainted with lead, such as chipped, lead-based paint. Another  common exposure is lead dust in carpets, with the dust flaking off  of paint on walls. When children play or roll around on carpets  coated with lead, they are in jeopardy. Lead is indestructible, and  once it has been ingested it is difficult for the human body to alter  or remove it. It can quietly build up in the body for months, or even  years, before the onset of symptoms. Lead toxicity can damage the  brain and central nervous system, resulting in impaired thinking,  reasoning, and perception.  8.\\xa0Lactose Intolerance.

Girls stop  growing taller around age sixteen, while boys continue to grow  taller until ages eighteen to twenty. One of the psychological and  emotional changes that takes place during this life stage includes  the desire for independence as adolescents develop individual  identities apart from their families.1 As teenagers make more and  more of their dietary decisions, parents or other caregivers and  authority figures should guide them toward appropriate, nutritious  choices. One way that teenagers assert their independence is by  choosing what to eat. They have their own money to purchase food  1.\\xa0Polan EU, Taylor DR. (2003).

Older adolescents  also can be curious and open to new ideas, which includes trying  new kinds of food and experimenting with their diet. For example,  teens will sometimes skip a main meal and snack instead. That is  not necessarily problematic. Their choice of food is more important  than the time or place.  However, too many poor choices can make young people  nutritionally vulnerable. Teens should be discouraged from eating  fast food, which has a high fat and sugar content, or frequenting  convenience stores and using vending machines, which typically  offer poor nutritional selections. Other challenges that teens may  face include obesity and eating disorders. At this life stage, young  people still need guidance from parents and other caregivers about  nutrition-related matters. It can be helpful to explain to young  people how healthy eating habits can support activities they enjoy,  such as skateboarding or dancing, or connect to their desires or  interests, such as a lean figure, athletic performance, or improved  cognition.  As during puberty, growth and development during adolescence  differs in males than in females. In teenage girls, fat assumes a larger  percentage of body weight, while teenage boys experience greater  muscle and bone increases. For both, primary and secondary sex  characteristics have fully developed and the rate of growth slows  with the end of puberty. Also, the motor functions of an older  adolescent are comparable to those of an adult.2 Again, adequate  nutrition and healthy choices support this stage of growth and  development.  2.\\xa0Polan EU, Taylor DR.

Nutrient needs are greater in adolescence than at any  other time in the life cycle, except during pregnancy. The energy  requirements for ages fourteen to eighteen are 1,800 to 2,400  calories for girls and 2,000 to 3,200 calories for boys, depending on  activity level. The extra energy required for physical development  during the teenaged years should be obtained from foods that  provide nutrients instead of “empty calories.” Also, teens who  participate in sports must make sure to meet their increased energy  needs.  Older adolescents are more responsible for their dietary choices  than younger children, but parents and caregivers must make sure  that  teens  continue  to  meet  their  nutrient  needs.  For  carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories  (203–293 grams for 1,800 daily calories). Adolescents require more  servings of grain than younger children, and should eat whole  grains, such as wheat, oats, barley, and brown rice. The Institute of  Medicine recommends higher intakes of protein for growth in the  adolescent population. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30 percent  of daily calories (45–135 grams for 1,800 daily calories), and lean  proteins, such as meat, poultry, fish, beans, nuts, and seeds are  excellent ways to meet those nutritional needs.  The AMDR for fat is 25 to 35 percent of daily calories (50–70 grams  for 1,800 daily calories), and the AMDR for fiber is 25–34 grams per  day, depending on daily calories and activity level. It is essential for  young athletes and other physically active teens to intake enough  fluids, because they are at a higher risk for becoming dehydrated.  Late Adolescence  |  891'},\n",

Again, vitamins and minerals  should be obtained from food first, with supplementation for  certain micronutrients only (such as iron).  The most important micronutrients for adolescents are calcium,  vitamin D, vitamin A, and iron. Adequate calcium and vitamin D are  essential for building bone mass. The recommendation for calcium  is 1,300 milligrams for both boys and girls. Low-fat milk and cheeses  are excellent sources of calcium and help young people avoid  saturated fat and cholesterol. It can also be helpful for adolescents  to consume products fortified with calcium, such as breakfast  cereals and orange juice. Iron supports the growth of muscle and  lean body mass. Adolescent girls also need to ensure sufficient iron  intake as they start to menstruate. Girls ages twelve to eighteen  require 15 milligrams of iron per day. Increased amounts of vitamin  C from orange juice and other sources can aid in iron absorption.  Also, adequate fruit and vegetable intake allows for meeting vitamin  A needs.

Because eating disorders often lead to malnourishment,  adolescents with an eating disorder are deprived of the crucial  nutrients their still-growing bodies need.  Eating disorders involve extreme behavior related to food and  exercise. Sometimes referred to as “starving or stuffing,” they  encompass a group of conditions marked by under eating or  overeating. Some of these conditions include:  • Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is a potentially fatal  condition characterized by under eating and excessive weight  loss. People with this disorder are preoccupied with dieting,  calories, and food intake to an unhealthy degree. Anorexics  have a poor body image, which leads to anxiety, avoidance of  food, a rigid exercise regimen, fasting, and a denial of hunger.  The condition predominantly affects females. Between 0.5 and  1 percent of American women and girls suffer from this eating  disorder.  • Binge-Eating Disorder. People who suffer from binge-eating  disorder experience regular episodes of eating an extremely  large amount of food in a short period of time. Binge eating is a  compulsive behavior, and people who suffer from it typically  feel it is beyond their control. This behavior often causes  feelings of shame and embarrassment, and leads to obesity,  high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, Type 2 diabetes,  and other health problems.

People who  suffer from it partake in binge eating, followed by  compensatory behavior, such as self-induced vomiting, laxative  use, and compulsive exercise. As with anorexia, most people  with this condition are female. Approximately 1 to 2 percent of  American women and girls have this eating disorder.4  Eating disorders stem from stress, low self-esteem, and other  psychological and emotional issues. It is important for parents to  watch for signs and symptoms of these disorders, including sudden  weight loss, lethargy, vomiting after meals, and the use of appetite  suppressants. Eating disorders can lead to serious complications  or even be fatal if left untreated. Treatment includes cognitive,  behavioral, and nutritional therapy.  Childhood and Adolescent Obesity  Children need adequate caloric intake for growth, and it is  important not to impose very restrictive diets. However, exceeding  caloric requirements on a regular basis can lead to childhood  obesity, which has become a major problem in North America.

This is more  appropriate than the BMI categories used for adults because the  body composition of children varies as they develop, and differs  between boys and girls.

Programs to address childhood obesity can include behavior  modification, exercise counseling, psychological support or  therapy, family counseling, and family meal-planning advice. For  most, the goal is not weight loss, but rather allowing height to catch  up with weight as the child continues to grow. Rapid weight loss is  not recommended for preteens or younger children due to the risk  of deficiencies and stunted growth.  Avoiding Added Sugars  One major contributing factor to childhood obesity is the  consumption of added sugars. Added sugars include not only sugar  added to food at the table, but also are ingredients in items such as  bread, cookies, cakes, pies, jams, and soft drinks. The added sugar  in store-bought items may be listed as white sugar, brown sugar,  high-fructose corn syrup, honey, malt syrup, maple syrup, molasses,  anhydrous dextrose, crystal dextrose, and concentrated fruit juice.  (Not included are sugars that occur naturally in foods, such as the  lactose in milk or the fructose in fruits.) In addition, sugars are  often “hidden” in items added to foods after they’re prepared, such  as ketchup, salad dressing, and other condiments. According to  the National Center for Health Statistics, young children and  adolescents consume an average of 322 calories per day from added  sugars, or about 16 percent of daily calories.7  7.\\xa0Ervin RB, Kit BK, Carroll MD.

This includes aerobic activity, along with bone- and  muscle-strengthening exercises.8 However, many young people fall  far short of this goal. Preteens must be encouraged to lead more  active lifestyles to prevent or treat childhood obesity. In the United  States, the Let’s Move! campaign inspires kids to start exercising.  This program, launched in 2010 by First Lady Michelle Obama,  works to solve the problem of rising obesity rates among children,  preteens, and teens. It offers information to parents and educators,  works to provide healthier food choices in schools and afterschool  programs, and helps children become more active. One way the  program promotes physical activity is by encouraging preteens and  teens to find something they love to do.

The CDC has implemented science  based physical activity guidelines for all Americans to follow in  hopes of creating a healthy lifestyle. In Hawai‘i, nearly 60% of all  adults meet the recommended aerobic physical activity guidelines.

Proper nutrition  and adequate physical activity at this stage not only promote  wellness in the present, but also provide a solid foundation for the  future.  With the onset of adulthood, good nutrition can help young adults  enjoy an active lifestyle. The body of an adult does not need to  devote its energy and resources to support the rapid growth and  development that characterizes youth. However, the choices made  during those formative years can have a lasting impact. Eating habits  and preferences developed during childhood and adolescence  influence health and fitness into adulthood. Some adults have  gotten a healthy start and have established a sound diet and regular  activity program, which helps them remain in good condition from  young adulthood into the later years. Others carry childhood  obesity into adulthood, which adversely affects their health.  However, it is not too late to change course and develop healthier  habits and lifestyle choices. Therefore, adults must monitor their  dietary decisions and make sure their caloric intake provides the  energy that they require, without going into excess.  Energy and Macronutrients  Young men typically have higher nutrient needs than young women.  For ages nineteen to thirty, the energy requirements for women  are 1,800 to 2,400 calories, and 2,400 to 3,000 calories for men,  depending on activity level. These estimates do not include women  who are pregnant or breastfeeding, who require a higher energy  intake. For carbohydrates, the AMDR is 45 to 65 percent of daily  calories. All adults, young and old, should eat fewer energy-dense  carbohydrates, especially refined, sugar-dense sources, particularly  for those who lead a more sedentary lifestyle.

The  guidelines also recommend that adults eat two 4-ounce servings (or  one 8-ounce serving) of seafood per week.  It is also important to replace proteins that are high in trans  fats and saturated fat with ones that are lower in solid fats and  calories. All adults should limit total fat to 20 to 35 percent of  their daily calories and keep saturated fatty acids to less than 10  percent of total calories by replacing them with monounsaturated  and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Avoid trans fats by limiting foods  that contain synthetic sources, such as partially hydrogenated oils.  The AMDR for fiber is 22 to 28 grams per day for women and  28 to 34 grams per day for men. Soluble fiber may help improve  cholesterol and blood sugar levels, while insoluble fiber can help  prevent constipation.  Micronutrients  Micronutrient needs in adults differ slightly according to sex. Young  men and women who are very athletic and perspire a great deal also  require extra sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Males require  more of vitamins C and K, along with thiamine, riboflavin, and  niacin. Females require extra iron due to menstruation. Therefore,  it can be beneficial for some young adults to follow a daily  multivitamin regimen to help meet nutrient needs. But as always,  it is important to remember “food first, supplements second.” Table  15.1  “Micronutrient  Levels  during  Adulthood”  shows  the  micronutrient recommendations for adult men and women.

The  early period of this stage is very different from the end. For example,  during the early years of middle age, many women experience  pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. In the latter part of this life  stage, women face perimenopause, which is a transition period that  leads up to menopause, or the end of menstruation. A number of  physical changes take place in the middle-aged years, including the  loss of bone mass in women due to dropping levels of estrogen  during menopause. In both men and women, visual acuity declines,  and by age forty there can be a decreased ability to see objects  at a close distance, a condition known as presbyopia.1 All of these  are signs of aging, as the human body begins to change in subtle  and not-so-subtle ways. However, a middle aged person can remain  vital, healthy, and near his or her physical peak with proper diet and  adequate exercise.  During this stage of the human life cycle, adults begin to  experience the first outward signs of aging. Wrinkles begin to  appear, joints ache after a highly active day, and body fat  accumulates.

Menopausal symptoms can vary, but  often include hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes. The  hormonal changes that occur during menopause can lead to a  number of physiological changes as well, including alterations in  body composition, such as weight gain in the abdominal area. Bone  loss is another common condition related to menopause due to  the loss of female reproductive hormones. Bone thinning increases  the risk of fractures, which can affect mobility and the ability to  complete everyday tasks, such as cooking, bathing, and dressing.6  Recommendations for women experiencing menopause or  perimenopause (the stage just prior to the end of the menstruation)  include:  • consuming a variety of whole grains, and other nutrient-dense  foods  • maintaining a diet high in fiber, low in fat, and low in sodium  • avoiding caffeine, spicy foods, and alcohol to help prevent hot  flashes  • eating foods rich in calcium, or taking physician-prescribed  calcium supplements and vitamin D  • doing stretching exercises to improve balance and flexibility  6.\\xa0Eating Right During Menopause.Academy of Nutrition  and Dietetics. http:/ /www.eatright.org/Public/ content.aspx?id=6809.

However, many older adults remain in relatively  good health and continue to be active into their golden years. Good  nutrition is often the key to maintaining health later in life. In  addition, the fitness and nutritional choices made earlier in life set  the stage for continued health and happiness.\\xa0 Older adults should  continue to consume nutrient-dense foods and remain physically  active. However, deficiencies are more common after age sixty,  primarily due to reduced intake or malabsorption. The loss of  mobility among frail, homebound elderly adults also impacts their  access to healthy, diverse foods.  Energy and Macronutrients  Due to reductions in lean body mass and metabolic rate, older  adults require less energy than younger adults. The energy  requirements for people ages fifty-one and over are 1,600 to 2,200  calories for women and 2,000 to 2,800 calories for men, depending  on activity level. The decrease in physical activity that is typical of  older adults also influences nutritional requirements. The AMDRs  for carbohydrates, protein, and fat remain the same from middle  age into old age. Older adults should substitute more unrefined  carbohydrates for refined ones, such as whole grains and brown  rice.

Also to help protect bones, vitamin D recommendations increase  to 10–15 micrograms per day for men and women. Vitamin B6  recommendations rise to 1.7 milligrams per day for older men and  1.5 milligrams per day for older women to help lower levels of  homocysteine and protect against cardiovascular disease. As adults  age, the production of stomach acid can decrease and lead to an  overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. This can affect the  absorption of vitamin B12\\xa0and cause a deficiency. As a result, older  adults need more B12 than younger adults, and require an intake  of 2.4 micrograms per day, which helps promote healthy brain  functioning. For elderly women, higher iron levels are no longer  needed postmenopause and recommendations decrease to 8  milligrams per day. People over age fifty should eat foods rich with  all of these micronutrients.

The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\xa0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

Typically, speech therapists,  physicians, and dietitians work together to determine the  appropriate diet for dysphagia patients.  Obesity in Old Age  Similar to other life stages, obesity is a concern for the elderly.  Adults over age sixty are more likely to be obese than young or  middle-aged adults. As explained throughout this chapter, excess  body weight has severe consequences. Being overweight or obese  increases the risk for potentially fatal conditions that can afflict the  elderly. They include cardiovascular disease, which is the leading  cause of death in the United States, and Type 2 diabetes, which  causes about seventy thousand deaths in the United States  annually.4 Obesity is also a contributing factor for a number of other  conditions, including arthritis.  For older adults who are overweight or obese, dietary changes to  promote weight loss should be combined with an exercise program  to protect muscle mass. This is because dieting reduces muscle as  well as fat, which can exacerbate the loss of muscle mass due to  aging. Although weight loss among the elderly can be beneficial, it  is best to be cautious and consult with a healthcare professional  before beginning a weight-loss program.  4.\\xa0Deaths and Mortality.

A condition known as the  anorexia of aging is characterized by poor food intake, which results  in dangerous weight loss. This major health problem among the  elderly leads to a higher risk for immune deficiency, frequent falls,  muscle loss, and cognitive deficits. Reduced muscle mass and  physical activity mean that older adults need fewer calories per  day to maintain a normal weight. It is important for health care  providers to examine the causes for anorexia of aging among their  patients, which can vary from one individual to another.  Understanding why some elderly people eat less as they age can  help healthcare professionals assess the risk factors associated with  this condition. Decreased intake may be due to disability or the lack  of a motivation to eat. Also, many older adults skip at least one meal  each day. As a result, some elderly people are unable to meet even  reduced energy needs.  Nutritional interventions should focus primarily on a healthy diet.  Remedies can include increasing the frequency of meals and adding  healthy, high-calorie foods (such as nuts, potatoes, whole-grain  pasta, and avocados) to the diet. Liquid supplements between meals  may help to improve caloric intake.5 Health care professionals  should consider a patient’s habits and preferences when developing  a nutritional treatment plan. After a plan is in place, patients should  be weighed on a weekly basis until they show improvement.  5.\\xa0Morley, JE. (1997). Anorexia of Aging: Physiologic and  Pathologic.

The  right foods provide numerous benefits at every stage of life. They  help an infant grow, an adolescent develop mentally and physically,  a young adult achieve his or her physical peak, and an older adult  cope with aging. Nutritious foods form the foundation of a healthy  life at every age.  Developing Habits  Eating habits develop early in life. They are typically formed within  the first few years and it is believed that they persist for years, if  not for life. So it is important for parents and other caregivers to  help children establish healthy habits and avoid problematic ones.  Children begin expressing their preferences at an early age. Parents  must find a balance between providing a child with an opportunity  for self-expression, helping a child develop healthy habits, and  making sure that a child meets all of their nutritional needs.  Bad habits and poor nutrition have an accrual effect. The foods  you consume in your younger years will impact your health as you  age, from childhood into the later stages of life. As a result, good  nutrition today means optimal health tomorrow. Therefore, it is best  to start making healthy choices from a young age and maintain them  as you mature. However, a recent report published in the American  Journal of Clinical Nutrition, suggests that adopting good nutritional  choices later in life, during the forties, fifties, and even the sixties,  may still help to reduce the risk of chronic disease as you grow  older.8  8.\\xa0Rivlin, RS.

However, improving your diet while  increasing physical activity helps to control weight, reduce fat mass,  and maintain muscle and bone mass.  There are a number of changes middle-aged adults can  implement, even after years of unhealthy choices. Choices include  eating more dark, green, leafy vegetables, substituting high-fat  proteins with lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and nuts, and  engaging in moderate physical activity for thirty minutes per day,  several days per week.

A well-rounded exercise program is crucial to  becoming and remaining healthy. Physical activity improves your  health in a number of ways. It promotes weight loss, strengthens  muscles and bones, keeps the heart and lungs strong, and helps to  protect against chronic disease. There are four essential elements  of physical fitness: cardiorespiratory, muscular strength, flexibility,  and maintaining a healthful body composition. Some enthusiasts  might argue the relative importance of each, but optimal health  requires some degree of balance between all four. For example,  the Hawai‘i Ironman is a vigorous race that consists of a 2.4 mile  swim, 112 mile bike, and a 26 mile run. All four elements of physical  fitness are vital in order to complete each leg of the race. To learn  more  about  the  Hawai‘i  Ironman,  visit  their  website  at  http:/ /www.ironman.com.  Some forms of exercise confer multiple benefits, which can help  you to balance the different elements of physical fitness. For  example, riding a bicycle for thirty minutes or more not only builds  cardiorespiratory endurance, it also improves muscle strength and  muscle endurance. Some forms of yoga can also build muscle  strength and endurance, along with flexibility. However, addressing  fitness standards in all four categories generally requires  incorporating a range of activities into your regular routine.

A  test subject usually walks or runs on a treadmill or rides a stationary  bicycle while the volume and oxygen content of exhaled air is  measured to determine oxygen consumption as exercise intensity  increases. At some point, the amount of oxygen consumed no longer  increases despite an increase in exercise intensity. This value of  oxygen consumption is referred to as VO2 max, ‘V’ meaning volume,  and ‘max’ meaning the maximum amount of oxygen (O2) an  individual is capable of utilizing. The higher the number, the more  oxygen you can consume, and the faster or longer you can walk, run,  bike, or swim, among other aerobic activities. VO2 max can increase  over time with training.2  Figure 16.1 VO2 Max Test  Physical-Activity- Infographic_UCM_450754_SubHomePage.jsp. Accessed  March 10, 2018.  2.\\xa0Ed Eyestone.

Anaerobic  exercise consists of short duration, high intensity movements that  rely on immediately available energy sources and require little or  no oxygen during the activity. This type of high intensity training  is used to build muscle strength by short, high intensity activities.  Building muscle mass is not just crucial for athletes and  bodybuilders—building muscle strength and endurance is important  for children, seniors, and everyone in between. The support that  your muscles provide allows you to work, play, and live more  efficiently. Strength training involves the use of resistance  machines, resistance bands, free weights, or other tools.

Although habitual physical activity can promote a more healthful  body composition, other factors like age, gender, genetics, and diet  contribute to an individual’s body composition. Women have a  higher healthy fat percentage than men. For adult women, a healthy  amount of body fat ranges from 20 to 32 percent. Adult males on the  other hand range from 10 to 22 percent of body fat.5  \\xa0 Metabolic Fitness  Being fit also includes metabolic fitness. It relates to the number  of calories you require to survive and the number of calories you  burn during physical activity. Recall that metabolism is the sum of  all chemical reactions that occur in the human body to conduct life’s  processes. Some are catabolic reactions that break down nutrients  to supply the body with cellular energy. The rate at which a person  burns calories depends on body composition, gender, age,  nutritional status, physical activity, and genetics.  Increasing your daily activity and shedding excess body fat helps  to improve metabolic fitness. Physical activity also makes weight  management easier because it increases energy needs and lean  body mass. During moderate to vigorous activity, energy  expenditure raises well above the resting rate. With continuous  5.\\xa0Measuring and Evaluating Body Composition.

The combination of increased energy  output, energy expenditure and basal needs over a long period of  time can have a major impact on total energy expenditure (see  Figure 16.2 “The Effect of Physical Activity on Energy Expenditure”).  The more energy you expend, the more foods you are able to  consume while maintaining a healthy weight. Any improvement to  metabolic fitness is beneficial and means a decrease in the risk for  developing diabetes, or other chronic conditions.  One measurement of metabolic fitness is basal metabolic rate, or  BMR, which is a measurement of the amount of energy required for  the body to maintain its basic functions while at rest, i.e. breathing,  heart beats, liver and kidney function, and so on. On average, BMR  accounts for between 50 and 70 percent of a person’s total daily  energy expenditure. Different factors can affect the BMR. For  example, a slender person who is tall has more body surface area  and therefore has a higher RMR relative to their body mass (weight).  Also, muscle utilizes more energy at rest than fat, so a person with  more muscle mass has a higher BMR.  A second measurement of metabolic fitness is the number of  calories burned during physical activity. The amount of calories  burned depends on how much oxygen is delivered to tissues, and  how efficiently metabolic reactions consume oxygen and, therefore,  expend calories. One of the best estimates of energy expenditure  during exercise is how much oxygen a person consumes. Recall that  VO2 max is a measure of the maximum cardiorespiratory capacity  to deliver oxygen to the body, especially to working muscles during  exercise.. Greater VO2 max is indicative of better cardiovascular  fitness. In contrast to RMR, VO2 max increases significantly with  exercise training due to training adaptations that increase the  body’s ability to deliver oxygen to working tissues and an increased  capacity of muscles to take up and utilize oxygen.

If you are lying  down reading a book or running the the Honolulu Marathon, these  macronutrients are always needed in the body.

The stored ATP is able to provide energy for only a few  seconds before it is depleted. Once the stored ATP is just about  used up, the body resorts to another high-energy molecule known  as creatine phosphate to convert ADP (adenosine diphosphate) to  ATP. After about 10 seconds, the stored creatine phosphate in the  muscle cells are also depleted as well.  About 15 seconds into exercise, the stored ATP and creatine  phosphate are used up in the muscles. The heart and lungs have still  not adapted to the increase need of oxygen so the muscles must  begin to produce ATP by anaerobic metabolism (without oxygen).  Anaerobic metabolism can produce ATP at a rapid pace but only  uses glucose as its fuel source. The glucose is obtained from the  blood of muscle glycogen. At around 30 seconds, anaerobic  pathways are operating at their full capacity but because the  availability of glucose is limited, it cannot continue for a long period  of time.  As your exercise reaches two to three minutes, your heart rate  and breathing rate have increased to supply more oxygen to your  muscles. Aerobic metabolism is the most efficient way of producing  ATP by producing 18 times more ATP for each molecule of glucose  than anaerobic metabolism.

Both anaerobic and aerobic  metabolism combine during exercise to ensure that the muscles  are equipped with enough ATP to carry out the demands placed on  them. The amount of contribution from each type of metabolism  will depend on the intensity of an activity. When low-intensity  activities are performed, aerobic metabolism is used to supply  enough ATP to muscles. However, during high-intensity activities  more ATP is needed so the muscles must rely on both anaerobic and  aerobic metabolism to meet the body’s demands.  During low-intensity activities, the body will use aerobic  metabolism over anaerobic metabolism because it is more efficient  by producing larger amounts of ATP. Fatty acids are the primary  energy source during low-intensity activity. With fat reserves in  the body being almost unlimited, low-intensity activities are able  to continue for a long time. Along with fatty acids, a small amount  954  |  Fuel Sources'},\n",

As glycogen stores are depleted,  fatigue will eventually set in.  Figure 16.6 The Effect of Exercise Intensity on Fuel Sources  The Fat-Burning Zone  The fat-burning zone is a low intensity aerobic activity  that keeps your heart rate between 60 and 69% of your  maximum heart rate. The cardio zone on the other hand is  a high intensity aerobic activity that keeps the heart rate  between about 70 to 85% of your maximum heart rate. So  which zone do you burn the most fat in?

However,  when looking at the actual numbers of calories burned,  higher intensity activity burns just as much fat and a much  greater total calories overall.  “Hitting the Wall” or “Bonking”  If you are familiar with endurance sports, you may have heard of  “hitting the wall” or “bonking.” These colloquial terms refer to the  extreme fatigue that sets in after about 120 minutes of performing  an endurance sport, such as marathon running or long-distance  956  |  Fuel Sources'},\n",

              "  'text': 'cycling. The physiology underlying “hitting the wall” means that  muscles have used up all their stored glycogen and are therefore  dependent on other nutrients to support their energy needs. Fatty  acids are transported from fat-storing cells to the muscle to rectify  the nutrient deficit. However, fatty acids take more time to convert  to energy than glucose, thus decreasing performance levels. To  avoid “hitting the wall” or “bonking,” endurance athletes load up  on carbohydrates for a few days before the event, known as  carbohydrate loading. This will maximize an athlete’s amount of  glycogen stored in their liver and muscle tissues. It is important not  to assume that carbohydrate loading works for everyone. Without  accompanied endurance training you will not increase the amount  of stored glucose. If you plan on running a five-mile race for fun  with your friend and decide to eat a large amount of carbohydrates  in the form of a big spaghetti dinner the night before, the excess  carbohydrates will be stored as fat. Therefore, if you are not an  endurance athlete exercising for more than 90 minutes,  carbohydrate loading will provide no benefit, and can even have  some disadvantages. Another way for athletes to avoid “hitting the  wall” is to consume carbohydrate-containing drinks and foods  during an endurance event. In fact, throughout the Tour de  France—a twenty-two-day, twenty-four-hundred-mile race—the  average cyclist consumes greater than 60 grams of carbohydrates  per hour.

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk, coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods. Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses, and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as a glossy appearance and smooth texture.'"

The Diabetes Prevention Trial demonstrated that by adhering to a diet containing between 1,200 and 1,800 kilocalories per day with a dietary fat intake goal of less than 25 percent and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes achieved a weight loss of 7 percent and significantly decreased their chances of developing Type 2 diabetes.15 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has a website that provides information and tips for helping diabetics answer the question, \\u201cWhat Can I Eat\\u201d. In regard to carbohydrates the ADA recommends diabetics keep track of the carbohydrates they eat and set a limit. These dietary practices will help keep blood-glucose levels in the target range.

It attracts and holds onto fat while it is simultaneously attracted to and held on to by water. Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes. Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats the absorptive lining of the digestive tract?As before, the answer is bile. Bile salts envelop the fatty acids and monoglycerides to form micelles. Micelles have a fatty acid core with a water-soluble exterior.\",\n          \"Image by\\u00a0Gtirouflet / CC BY-SA 3.0 dense cortical bone is about 10 percent porous and it looks like many concentric circles, similar to the rings in a tree trunk, sandwiched together (Figure 2.27 \\u201cCortical (Compact) Bone\\u201d).

These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.',\n",

        "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",

        "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
        "\\nExample 3:\n",
        "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
        "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\\n- Water There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities: water. Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).\\n- Figure 1.1 The Macronutrie nts: Carbohydrat es, Lipids, Protein, and Water Proteins Proteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called amino acids. Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific proteins. Figure 1.1 The Macronutrients: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Protein, and Water Introduction | 7\\n- Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: • Describe basic concepts in nutrition • Describe factors that affect your nutritional needs • Describe the importance of research and scientific methods to understanding nutrition What are Nutrients? The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction\\n- Protein Necessary for tissue formation, cell reparation, and hormone and enzyme production. It is essential for building strong muscles and a healthy immune system. Carbohydrates Provide a ready source of energy for the body and provide structural constituents for the formation of cells. Fat Provides stored energy for the body, functions as structural components of cells and also as signaling molecules for proper cellular communication. It provides insulation to vital organs and works to maintain body temperature. Vitamins Regulate body processes and promote normal body-system functions. Minerals Regulate body processes, are necessary for proper cellular function, and comprise body tissue. Water Transports essential nutrients to all body parts, transports waste products for disposal, and aids with body temperature maintenance. \\xa0 Learning Activities Technology Note: The second edition of the Human Nutrition Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook features interactive learning activities.\\xa0 These activities are available in the web-based textbook and not available in the downloadable versions (EPUB, Digital PDF, Print_PDF, or Open Document).\\n\\nRelevant passages: <extract relevant passages from the context here>\\nUser query: What are the macronutrients, and what roles do they play in the human body?\\nAnswer:<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n\""

There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.',\n",

Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).',\n",

Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific proteins.

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction',\n",
